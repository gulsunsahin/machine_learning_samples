Mortgage;Receive multiple misleading mortgage refinance letters from Service 1st Mortgage Inc. Letters imply they are from Veterans Administration and /or current mortgage lender. Letters attempt to get you to think they are calling about your existing loan and need to take action on your existing loan. In reality, it is a refinance offer ( at higher rate ) and attempts to mislead consumer about escrow refunds. See attached copy of letter. 
Debt collection;XXXX has claimed I owe them {$27.00} for XXXX years despite the PROOF of PAYMENT I sent them : canceled check and their ownPAID INVOICE for {$27.00}! They continue to insist I owe them and collection agencies are after me. How can I stop this harassment for a bill I already paid four years ago? 
Mortgage;XXXX was submitted XX/XX/XXXX. At the time I submitted this complaint, I had dealt with Rushmore Mortgage directly endeavoring to get them to stop the continuous daily calls I was receiving trying to collect on a mortgage for which I was not responsible due to bankruptcy. They denied having knowledge of the bankruptcy, even though I had spoken with them about it repeatedly and had written them repeatedly referencing the bankruptcy requesting them to cease the pursuit, they continued to do so. When they were unable to trick me into paying, force me into paying in retaliation they placed reported to my credit bureaus a past due mortgage amount that had been discharged in Federal Court. On XX/XX/XXXX Rushmore responded the referenced complaint indicating that they would remove the reporting from my bureau, yet it is still there now in XX/XX/XXXX. I would like them to remove it immediately and send me a letter indicating that it should not have been there in the first place and they are going to remove it from all my bureaus. Rushmore, when speaking to me, represented themselves as the new note holder, but when CFPB was involved, they identified themselves as the servicing agency for XXXX XXXX XXXX. This credit bullying and racial discrimination practices is damaging to anyone who is exposed to these tactics and this needs to stop. Them denying their intent and then walking away with no penalties of any kind is one of the reasons it continues. Please assist me in procuring the resolution once and for all.

Credit reporting;I have been disputing incorrect information on my XXXX & Trans Union credit report but they are unwilling to allow me to dispute their  investigation results . The creditors are XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. The report reflects late payments and the information is inaccurate. Both creditors have agreed to have the items corrected on all XXXX credit bureaus but only XXXX made the correction. 
Debt collection;I have reached out to the company. However, they never responded. Unfortunately, I was the victim of identity theft. I have done everything required of me by law to dispute the fraudulent items on my credit report. I sent a letter to  Sun Trust  on XX/XX/2014 via XXXX certified mail. The company refuses to honor my rights under the FDCPA & the FCRA as a victim of identity theft to remove the fraudulent inquiry that was submitted without my knowledge, consent and/or authorization. Please find attached the notice that was sent out along with the attached certified receipt. Information can be tracked online using referenced information.

Credit reporting;I have submitted XXXX disputes to Trans Union credit bureau regarding incorrect payment history for an account on my report - XXXX. The payment history reflects multiple late payments when in fact the account was paid in a timely manner. I have also contacted the creditor but no answer has been given after numerous attempts. I am not sure what else to do given the attempts and lack of proper response from the credit bureau. 
Debt collection;Reached out to them however, never got a response. Unfortunately, I was the victim of identity theft. I have done everything required of me by law to dispute the fraudulent items on my credit report. I sent a letter to  Flagship Credit  on XXXX via XXXX certified mail.

Credit reporting;I am unable to obtain my experian credit report on line. I am also unable to access my free anual credit report online via the annualcreditreport.com website. I was told the size of the report is causing this and may be related to the number of soft inquiries generated by reviewing my own report. As I had previously been a victim of Identity Theft, I checked my report almost daily for new/unauthorized inquiries or accounts appearing. That is why online access is so important to me. Now, apparently the file size will not allow online access and I must mail in a form to get a copy of my report. For someone who is monitoring their credit for identity theft in the event someone attempts to open an account in my name, I need to be able to access my credit information without waiting two weeks for XXXX in the mail. 
Consumer Loan;Around XXXX we consolidated our loans and paid off a loan to Chrysler financial for an automotive loan. In XX/XX/XXXX we applied for a lost title at our local town office in Tennessee. At this time it was made known to us that TD Financial XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX lien on our title. I was directed to TD financial XXXX XXXX, then to My title Support XXXX, and back to TD financial to find that there is a  balance due of {$85.00}  for  charges and fees . I have NEVER received any notifications from XXXX, TD Auto Finance or any other representative in the TEN to TWELVE YEARS since that loan was paid off. TD Auto Finance is located in XXXX Maine and I have never transacted business with them. I requested a supervisor call me to discuss the  balance due  on XXXX/XXXX/15, and 1 week has passed with no response despite the XXXX calls I have placed to their  customer service department  I find it very concerning and unethical that a corporation can quietly hold a  balance due  for more than 10 years and then demand a consumer pay. 
Debt collection;Sent a few letter to different addresses listed for the company and never got any response. Unfortunately, I was the victim of identity theft. I have done everything required of me by law to dispute the fraudulent items on my credit report. I sent a letter to  JPM Chase d/b/a JP Morgan Chase  on XX/XX/2014 via XXXX certified mail.

Mortgage;Wells Fargo Mortgage began foreclosure action due to non-payment that we had set up auto pay option on. Did not receive notification that auto payment option was cancelled nor did we receive information regarding foreclosure action until we attempted to make a purchase. We contacted them and asked if they could waive late fees and reinstatement fees since we were not notified. After speaking with them at length, they indicated after conducting their research they felt they were not at fault and denied any waiver of either fees. They felt that regardless of any previous discussion that they had sent written notification to us that there were no payments set up automatically, and that we should have contacted them once we received that. After advising them we did nt receive the letter they stated that we should have been monitoring our account and making sure the payments were being made and we would have known that way. Throughout a month s worth of phone calls with multiple employees of Wells Fargo beginning on XXXX/XXXX/15, I was provided misinformation almost every time I called in. Some examples include the individuals each time had to be explained the entire story and they would explain what their records reflected on the account and none of the information was what was actually discussed. They had indicated we had never requested reinstatement letter, then that it would be mailed when we had asked for a fax  they stated we had not received it because they were busy and to check back, and once we did they stated a second reinstatement letter had been requested  after following up again we were told they had begun a loan modification process which was never requested  when asking for a supervisor the call was conveniently disconnected  each time we called the same number we received a different staff member sometimes in a different state  every call they were asked if we could go into an office and speak with someone and were told there was none local  after multiple requests for information sent in some other form than a fax we were told they do nt use email only XXXX. After XXXX Wells Fargo and calling a different number we were told XXXX person had been assigned to our case. This was not until XXXX/XXXX/15. After finally receiving a call from this person after leaving messages, we were told the request to waive fees would be denied and a letter would be sent XXXX, we have still not received it. We were told if the fees were not paid by XXXX that there would be additional fees incurred and they were still pursuing the foreclosure. We ended up paying the fees to get the home out of foreclosure and received a verbal answer that this has been done. When asking for written confirmation, we were advised we would receive this via email which was interesting because up until this time this was not possible. We still do nt have this letter. They had said they do not use electronic communication for security purposes. We were also advised we would receive a written account of their research and determination not to waive fees which would be sent overnight mail but have not received this either. When asked if our credit had been updated to reflect that we were current, we were told they would take care of this only after our next month mortgage payment was made which is not due until the beginning of the month. The money for our mortgage payments was being payroll deducted into a Wells Fargo checking account and was sitting there rather than being taken out for the mortgage. We do nt even bank with them normally and only opened the account for the mortgage payments. We received XXXX random letters via XXXX about attempts to contact us and update our acct. as though they are trying to cover their backs on previous attempts never made. These letters were received no problem, but those requested and promised have not as of XXXX/XXXX/15. 
Bank account or service;I am the Trustee of my sister s estate. She passed away on XXXX. There will be no probate. She had a pour-over will so anything not titled to her trust and anything w/o a beneficiary goes into her trust. I contacted Discover Bank ( an online bank ) for the XXXX time on XXXX/XXXX/15 where my sister, XXXX XXXX XXXX, has a savings account. ( I have had XXXX other contacts, all initiated by me. ) I sent them my certified documents ( about XXXX pages in total over the last month ) stating who I was, about the trust, etc.. and asked XXXX questions : Were any beneficiaries listed on this account and if so, who? ( So I can let them know as it would be my niece and nephew. ) What was the Date of Death value ( which I must report to the IRS to account for the value of the estate )? What is the current value? They told me that once they received my papers they would answer my questions. Now they are saying they wo nt  that they do nt  recognize the authority of XXXX County ( WA ) Superior Court and that they want  Probate  papers. They refuse to recognize my authority and they also refused to bundle up all my documents and send them to their attorneys. I am at an impasse. 
Credit card;I applied for a credit card and was accepted from usaa. they sent me a welcomepack and I recived a bill shortly after. I do all my banking online so I tried to pay the bill right away. they told me I could not hat they needed more information so I sent them morewas told that was good and I should get a reply within 2 to 3 business days never did get a reply so I contacted them again. they told me they needed more info so I sent them more and they told me that they would get back to me in 2 to 3 business days they never did. I got another bill in the mail plus emails on my computer called them up and they told me the last info I sent them was nt right so I explained what I sent them and was told that it would work and they would get back a hold of me in 2 to 3 business days and that I would be able to pay the bill at that time i waited to here back from them never did and contacted them again. they told me the info was not good enough and I had to send more information. I at this point told them to forget it and take me out of there system.they toldme okay and I would recive conformation in two to 3 buissness day in I never did after numorous calls and complaints I am still in there system they turned this into the credit agency during this whole process and it shows as a unpaid bill it has lowerd my credit score enough that ino longer qualify for the home loan i was getting I had a XXXX before all this its now down to a XXXX I needed a XXXX and every thing was fine. so I am stuck staying at a friends house because of a card that I never seen had or used and being forced into getting checks to pay them for something I do nt have they said the only way I can pay for this bill for a card I do nt have and never had is to get checks and mail it to them I am totally frustaited with this hole thing 
Debt collection;This debt collector has called me numerous times from a private number, contacts every single member of my family numerous times, and has called me at work. They even called my oldest daughters boyfriend, who has never been affiliated with me, on a phone number he just received 3 days ago. I have told them to not call me again, I do not owe this debt and the calls keep coming. They are now stating that they have a case against me and they want my home or work address so they can serve me papers. I want this to stop. 
Credit reporting;i attempted to obtain a free annual credit report from the XXXX reporting services via the website : XXXX. No problem with XXXX. XXXX required a written application be mailed to them and Transunion steered me to a new page or website where I was not allowed to proceed without subscribing to a service which required me to pay an initial fee of {$1.00} for the report ( {$0.00} for my  score  ) and further agreeing to and paying a recurring charge of approximately {$18.00}. It is my belief that I am entitled under the law to a FREE credit report. why is TransUnion being permitted to violate the law with this deceptive practice? Please remedy this violation and require them to send me a free credit report as soon as possible. 
Credit reporting;This is the XXXX time that I have contacted XXXX in regards to inaccurate negative information on my credit report. The information being reported is erroneous. First of all XXXX XXXX XXXX is not the original creditor. SLU care is and I sent a letter to XXXX as well as the other XXXX credit bureaus which have removed this information from my report.

Credit reporting;In XX/XX/XXXX, while discussing an unrelated business mater with a current lender, I was made aware that an account, I did not authorize or initiate, had me listed as a cosigner. I immediately notified the lender that I was a victim of identity fraud and requested to see the information they had on file. In turn, I checked my credit reports, confirmed the presence of the fraudulent account, and contacted each of the XXXX ( XXXX ) credit reporting companies and disputed the information. At varying dates in XX/XX/XXXX, each of the credit reporting companies ( CRCs ) reported that the account was confirmed by the lender. To date, the fraudulent information remains on my credit file and [ neither ] CRC has ever notated my credit profile about the account being disputed. After [ several ] additional telephonic requests to the lender between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, the lender mailed me a copy of the loan origination documents along with its internal ID theft package. I immediately filed a law enforcement report ( LER ) with my local Sheriff XXXX Office and returned the original package and supporting documentation to the lender in XX/XX/XXXX. The supporting documentation included a copy of the lender s loan origination document, my LER, drivers license, social security card, and hand writing samples. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified by a potential employer that I was deemed unsuitable due the presence of delinquent financial information on my credit report. In that same notification, I was provided a copy of my combined credit report which still contained the fraudulent account on each of the CRC s reports. I began researching laws and learned about the FCRA and the FTC. After learning that the combination of an LER and FTC Identity Theft Affidavit ( ITA ) produce an Identity Theft Report ( IDR ), I filed an ITA on the FTC s website. In turn, I sent [ via certified mail ] FTC s CRC-template letters and supporting documentation to each of the XXXX credit reporting companies requesting that the fraudulent account be blocked, removed, and that a extended fraud alert be placed on my credit file as per the FCRA. The supporting documentation for each submission of FTC s CRC-template letter included a copy of the lender s loan origination document  my credit report, drivers license, social security card, and hand writing samples  as well as FCRA Section 611. According to XXXX tracking, the CRCs received their certified letters on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX [ XXXX ], respectively. To date, each CRC has placed an extended fraud alert but has [ not ] blocked the fraudulent account information from my respective credit profile [ or ] contacted me declining my request to block the fraudulent information. In fact, XXXX CRC will not allow me to order a credit report directly and advised ( via telephone ) that my IDR was not sufficient but would not provide its justification method in making that determination. Subsequently, and, respectively, I have ordered additional credit reports which indicate each CRC s non-compliance the FCRA s imposed time limits. To their credit, XXXX CRCs have listed the fraudulent account as disputed/under investigation. Additionally, I sent [ for the XXXX time, via certified mail ] FTC s lender-template letter and supporting documentation to the lender requesting that the lender block, absolve me of responsibility, and stop inaccurately furnishing the fraudulent account information to the CRCs. The supporting documentation to my submission of FTC s lender-template letter included a copy of the lender s loan origination document and ID Theft Affidavit  my IDR, credit report, drivers license, social security card, and hand writing samples  as well as FTC s Notice to Furnishers ) According to XXXX tracking, the lender received its certified letter on XX/XX/XXXX. To date, the lender has not made any contact with me. XXXX : FTC XXXX # XXXX 
Debt collection;I was called by a blocked number today. The guy told me he was going to come to my work tomorrow to  serve  me. He said he just wanted to give me the heads up. Obviously, this shocked me. I asked him what charges and from whom. He said he could not tell me that, but he could give me the party s number ( XXXX ) and my case number. I immediately called the number he gave me. It was Dispute Resolution Services. My  case manager  ( XXXX XXXX ) says I owe them {$2900.00} from a check into cash loan I got on XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX said that if I did not resolve this today, I would be served by the guy that originally called me, who would be accompanied by a uniformed officer and that my boss would also have to sign the papers. I asked why they were coming to my work. He told me that they would try my house XXXX, but if they failed to find me there, they would go to my work. I asked when they were planning on doing this. He said between XXXX and XXXX tomorrow. He told me I could face up to 1 year in jail and have to pay an additional {$1000.00} penalty because they are charging me with check fraud under section XXXX of some law. I asked him if I could get a copy of the application from the original debtor and he said no, stating that the application was to be used against me in court. I told him I was going to need to call him back, because I was at work and a bit in shock from what he was saying. He said he would be able to give me until XXXX to call him back, or he would move forward with these charges and he gave me his extension ( XXXX ). After getting off the phone with him, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX to verify this debt. They said they sold my debt to XXXX, but XXXX is known for allowing other debtors collect on their behalf. She said many times, these are scams and get people to pay way more than what they actually owe. I was on the phone with her for a long time while she tried to find this company and/or anything about XXXX XXXX. The only thing she found said that they had their license revoked a few years ago. She was very sweet and reassured me that I was not going to jail and that she would contact XXXX to notify them of this situation. She also gave me XXXX s number to follow up with them myself. I called XXXX, but they were closed and the voice recording asked me to leave my phone number and my full social security number.. umm, no thanks! I then called XXXX XXXX back at XXXX XXXX XXXX ( at XXXX ). XXXX did nt answer. I left him XXXX voice mails from XXXX to XXXX. NO CALL BACK!! Now, I have to go to work tomorrow in fear that a cop and some guy will show up to serve me, to publicly humiliate me and/or threaten me with more scary tactics like  jail time  and  thousands of dollars in penalties . 
Mortgage;My wife & I had a FHA backed XXXX yr mortage serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX, signed in XXXX, XXXX. We filed for Chapter XXXX bankruptcy protection in XXXX XXXX, including our mortgage in the filing. All mortgage payments & arrearages were being serviced per our Trustee s Agreement on time, & without prejudice, even as we attempted to refinance our mortgage to a much more advantageous rate. We finally found someone to do an FHA Streamline on our mortgage, when we were informed that XXXX XXXX XXXX filed an insurance claim in XXXX XXXX against our FHA MIP due to our loan  being delinquent.  Our mortgage was then  picked up  by Caliber Home Loans, whom we were informed would be our new loan servicer. We were also told we no longer had an FHA Loan, according to Caliber. We have no idea how we could be taken out of our FHA loan-preventing our Streamline Refinance- & put into some  XXXX status  as we were informed that our mortgage is now in. In addition, we are still paying FHA MIP payments in our mortgage payments on our mortgage since Caliber took over our mortgage, as well as we have yet to have our mortgage payments be reduced after a significant drop in our homeowners policy as well. 
Credit card;I have XXXX credit cards with Capital One. I had some financial difficulties and got a couple of months behind on all XXXX cards. I called Capital One to make arrangements on XXXX of the cards to pay {$60.00} over XXXX months to get caught up and gave them my bank account info to take the money out automatically. XXXX the other XXXX cards, I was able to pay them off in full. I called in to Capital One and made the payments over the phone. A few days later, I went online to check that the accounts reflected the new balance and found that each XXXX had a note that say the accounts had been suspended. I called in to Capital One to ask what this meant and they said that I could no longer use the accounts but they would remain open and I would still get a yearly charge for them but I could not use them again. They did not inform me when they took my money, nearly {$1000.00}, that I would not be able to use the cards anymore. Also, when I checked my credit, they reported me for being 120 days late which I was not, and never updated my balances to zero. They are still reporting the old balances. 
Money transfers;I was scammed into sending money for a XXXX bonus winnings randomly selected and the number they use is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, New York XXXX and the phone number is ( XXXX ) XXXX 
Bank account or service;US Bank had XXXX accounts under my name and I thought you could write a check for XXXX account to deposit it into the other account, because XXXX account I thought had overdraft protection. XXXX disagreed with me and said that I was XXXX XXXX  checks. I m XXXX and I feel she reported me to Chex Systems for a poor reason, granted that I was confused and had no idea this was nt allowed. She took advantage of my XXXX. 
Consumer Loan;I am hoping you can help me resolve what I feel is unfair reporting and unclear communication with a prior lender about an old account in default. This is in regards to my auto loan previously with XXXX finance which is now Ally Financial. I did voluntarily repo the car however they are currently not showing accurate pay history on my credit report and have not communicated when this will be removed due to the 7 year rule. From my understanding of the fair credit reporting act a creditor is supposed to remove and no longer report a negative item 7 years from the XXXX late payment or negative information is shown. The account number for this account is XXXXMy name is XXXX XXXXMy Social is XXXX. I have disputed with both the credit buros and sent a letter to XXXX. I received a form letter response but they did not answer my question regarding my pay history and when they would cease reporting this negative information on my credit report. I would like this removed as soon as possible and if they feel this is not yet supposed to be removed legally I am at least owed a very clear explanation of when it is scheduled to be removed. Ally s address isAlly FinancialXXXX XXXX XXXX, MN XXXX have not found a working phone number to discuss this with their credit reporting department. Thanks you, XXXX XXXX ( cel ) 
Debt collection;They are calling upwards of XXXX times a day, often with repeated phone calls occurring within minutes of each other. They are also switching phone numbers every few days, making it very difficult to get them to stop calling. In addition this company, despite having called in excess of XXXX times, has never left a single voice mail message. Finally, based on the calling pattern and lack of messages, it appears that the company is improperly using automatic dialers ( ie, robo dialing ), which we have never given consent to, putting them in violation of the the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Credit reporting;I have tried to request my annual credit reports from all three credit reporting agencies. ( XXXX, Experian, & XXXX ). After asking for my general information, and my social security number, date of birth, etc., I was asked XXXX or XXXX questions about my checking account, if a home i currently live in or did live in is in a specific town, if i worked at a certain company, etc. I went through this XXXX ( because it timed out both times ) but the XXXX time I had a problem because I had to look for the deed to my home, to see the exact year it was built, the question was ridiculous. It asked the year it was built, not the approx. year it was built, but the year it was built. I bought the home in XX/XX/XXXX. It was built ( i have since found out ) in XX/XX/XXXX. I knew it was around then, but not exactly that year. The answers to the questions were : XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. I mean, if i was guessing, which is what i would have been doing, it could have gone either way XXXX XXXX??? it ends up i can not get my reports on line now. I am very upset about this. The people generating these questions should think a bit before putting them out there. I recently had to answer a question for my bank and it was about a cousin of mine and if he owned land in some state, I havent even seen him in years. It is ridiculous. regards 
Debt collection;They have been calling me XXXX times a day, XXXX every hour on the hour from XXXX to XXXX. Sending mail to my house, looked up my mother, brother and father on public record and called them about my loan, call from a blocked number and have lied about it. Lied to my brother saying I listed him as a reference ( I did not ). Then when I asked how they got the information, they told me they looked it up on public record. I told them it was XXXX, they told me it was not. I have emailed them saying it s XXXX, yet they continue to call. 
Mortgage;My mortgage company city mortgage would rather foreclose on me then except my monthly payments. I ve been fighting with my mortgage company for two years or more.

Credit card;I sent the below letter to Bank of America for a resolution, which they denied. I believe their actions are unjust. I am writing you with a very heavy heart. I am extremely dishearten and dissatisfied with the level of insensitivity and lack of understanding and communications received from Bank of America s representatives regarding my closed account, now  charged off . I am requesting the charge off be reversed due to miscommunications and technicality. In XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a representative, who I notified that I was having hardship ( became unemployed ). She notified me that my account would be charged off on XX/XX/XXXX. Being XX/XX/XXXX was on a Saturday ( weekend ). I paid the bill on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, which was paid the next business day, XX/XX/XXXX. I had no idea my account would be charged off on a weekend and neither was I explained this information in detailed. Additional information : I also was told that I had a cease and desist order on my account, which too was puzzling. I never requested a cease and desist and was never told such an order would be put on my account when requesting not to contacted via telephone. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, the represented mentioned that the cease and desist stopped all phone calls and correspondence, which I would have never agreed to. Requesting not to receive phone calls is totally different then not receiving mail. I never knew there was an issue until now, because I was still receiving my monthly statements. Therefore, I did nt get any reminder notice for the upcoming charge off or notice of the actual charge off or any notice pertaining to this cease and desist order that I did not consent to. I have had several hardships during the course of this account from being unemployment several times, XXXX, newborn ( a bundle of joy, nevertheless a financial adversity ), accepting a XXXX  only  XXXX position, which was insufficient, thus having to move in with my mother, then recently in XX/XX/XXXX, becoming unemployed again. Through it all, I did the best I could. Now, that I have almost completed my payment in full, it is quite unfair and disappointing to receive a charge-off on my account for a difference of XXXX days, of which XXXX were weekend days. Furthermore, I never receive any notification pertaining to this charge-off, due to the above mentioned unauthorized communications disconnect. I thought Bank of America was in the business of helping people and that Bank of America would much rather see me pay my bill and build up my credit vs. damage my credit with a derogatory  charge-off . I am asking that you have compassion, thereby reversing the charge-off on the aforementioned account, in so doing allowing me to pay my outstanding balance in the amount of {$1200.00} without such a steep penalty. I really like Bank of America and hope to be a customer again, when my financial situation changes for the better. Thank you kindly for your consideration, time and immediate attention to this matter. Providing you require additional information, please feel free to contact me. 
Mortgage;I have lived in my home for 30 years and am in danger of losing it at auction due to the actions of my lender Caliber Loans. I have endured extraordinary hardship and have slowly rebuilt my life and situation. However, Caliber has refused to open a review of my current financial situation, has not assigned a case manager or dedicated contact and has told me the only options is to short sale or reinstate the loan in full, which is not possible. I do nt understand how they can refuse to even CONSIDER working with me or helping me or looking at my current financial situation, which has changed considerably since my last review. They received millions in bailout dollars, I thought they were supposed to look at my information and give me a chance. I refinanced into this loan in 2007. A little over a year later when my wife turned XXXX she decided to take off and go on the road as a XXXX, abandoning me and the kids. XXXX. There were long periods of unexplained absences and several months later I had divorce papers drafted. XXXX At that time I had been taking care of the kids and making the mortgage payment since she had deserted us six months earlier. However the police came and we went to court. I could not afford an Attorney and my wife was granted XXXX as well as control of the house. I was forced to leave the house and my kids and had to move into an apartment. My employer found out about the XXXX and I lost my job as well. I eventually found a job XXXX and had to XXXX in my spare time to sell it in order to keep myself fed. I obviously was not in a position to make the mortgage payment. During that time my wife never made the mortgage payment, and let the house, the lawn and the pool go. I started my own company doing right sizing -- I am brought in to save them money and have slowly built this up into a good income source. I fought the XXXX and was eventually able to get back into the house and was able to get wife out and divorce finalized. I tried to put my life back in order XXXX step at a time. I contacted XXXX to see what could be done and at XXXX point I was apparently offered an interest only modification. I found out about this after the fact, I did not see the paperwork until the offer had expired and I suspect that my ex wife who was still lurking around at that time had something to do with that. I have tried since then to re-engage with Caliber and have not made any progress. My business and income have continually increased and now my son who lives in the house is working as well and contributing his share. If Caliber were to actually take the time to review me for all retention options, something they are REQUIRED to do due to their acceptance of government bailout funds they would see that I fit into guidelines for assistance. Their continued refusal to even give me a seat at the negotiating table is outrageous. 
Mortgage;I contacted Select Portfolio, my mortgage servicing company, in order the obtain a letter entailing the amount I need for reinstatement to avoid eminent foreclosure. They sent a letter of reinstatement, but it did not state that this amount was the amount needed to avoid eminent foreclosure. When I contacted them to inform them of this, they related that they do nt write letters of this nature. They also stated that they are not in the processing of foreclosure upon my property, but in litigation . I was confused.  Foreclosure is the legal process in which a bank or other secured creditor sells or repossesses a parcel of real property after the owner has failed to comply with an agreement between the lender and borrower called a mortgate  or deed of trust  . Since they are in the process of trying to force a sale of my house through the courts, and represent XXXX bank, how can they say that I am not in danger of eminent foreclosure? They further directed me to make a payment immediately. I am unsure where that payment would go nor am I sure it would be used to avoid eminent foreclosure. I am in the process of getting help to work with the bank, but they do nt seem interested in working with me. They said all of our conversations are recorded, so there should be no discrepancy as to each conversation that transpired. 
Credit card;I recently sent an online secure message to Capital One asking if they can lower the interest rate on a XXXX because they approved another XXXX with a much lower interest rate. I also inquired why they gave me such a low credit limit, considering they approved me for a new XXXX with a low interest rate and high credit limit. They refuse to respond in writing, and only respond via online secure messaging trying to get me to call in. I asked for the matter to be escalated to the corporate office for written response, and instead, someone left a voicemail message. I am NOT calling them back. I have the legal right to insist all communications with banks and credit card companies be in writing via online secure messaging. So then, I went online to activate the new XXXX card, and they ve blocked it, as I ve received an account restricted message. I ve already warned them that I would file a CFPB complaint if they continue to fail to respond in writing, but now that they ve restricted my new XXXX account, I m filing this complaint, as clearly, that is an act of retaliation. If CFPB fails to appropriately address this matter, and instead, simply sends me Capital One s response, then considers the matter closed, I will report this to my Congressman, as well as post it on the Internet, as clearly, that indicates CFPB is just a  dummy  agency created for the sole purpose of keeping the OCC from having to handle consumer complaints. 
Mortgage;My former mortgage company was bought out by Green Tree. My statements from Green Tree are now about {$300.00} more a month. I have a fixed rate and nothing else has changed. I went to my financial institutions mortgage specialist and he reviewed my disclosure statement from Green Tree. It looks as though Green Tree raised my PMI and is now charging me {$4000.00} a year ( approximately ) for PMI that I have not had on my mortgage for the last 11 years. I feel this is a dishonest charge from them. Furthermore, the mortgage specialist seemed to think it was not a legal tactic to raise the PMI by that much. 
Credit card;I am being called by USAA credit card services XXXX times a day regarding a credit card debt. They call on weekends, Holidays, and sometimes at XXXX at night. 
Mortgage;I have been denied a modification with OCWEN XXXX times. There are numerous servicing errors and documentation regarding ownership of the loan has been misrepresented which has contributed to my denial of a modification. I also had an attorney send a Cease and Desist Letter to XXXX XXXX, repping XXXX, in reference to illegal foreclosure actions taken in violation of MGL 244 s. 35A ( b ). 
Debt collection;This company continues to report on my credit report after I sent them a letter telling them that this account was not mine and I have no idea what it is or who it belongs to! I asked for proof of a signed contract, I asked for a license to collect in my state, I asked for copies of all information referenced for this debt and still to date, I have not received anything but harassment from this company! THIS IS NOT MY DEBT!

Mortgage;I have had numerous problems with Green Tree Servicing. I ALWAYS pay my regular payment plus an additional {$50.00} each month for the principal. In many cases, the principal is not posted to my account. For my last payment, this company only said I paid {$110.00} when in fact I paid $ XXXX.Also, my principal payment was not credited. I have been given NOTHING but the runaround from this company! 
Bank account or service;I had a charge that was charged my card as an authorization by XXXX and when i stayed at hotel as told it would drop off and decided to pay in increments for hotel stay ( {$330.00}, {$160.00}, {$890.00} ) as i did nt know how long we would be staying for whole reservation as home was nt ready to move in so we changed our reservation. After checking out i noticed my XXXX XXXX credit card had a charge for the full amount of {$1300.00} and authorization never dropped off. When this happened i contacted bank of america and dispute these and filed a claim for these duplicate charges. XXXX out of the XXXX charges were credit back as permanent credit ( {$330.00} & {$160.00} ). The XXXX was still not credited back after going back and forth with bank trying to get this resolved. The bank made errors when resubmitting and caused delays and issues with claim which was their error. In XXXX i received claim response from merchant and then was allowed to submit rebuttal for claim which i did and faxed back to bank for all XXXX amounts. How can they process XXXX but not the XXXX correctly when there all a part of same amount. They stated it was past time frame. when clearly i responded immediately when they requested along with others they gave me credit back for so it was not past time frame. I then called back in XXXX to resubmit the {$890.00} for the XXXX time. I even specified there was a XXXX XXXX statement on file showing the charge was made on another card and was never refunded. I never received any notiice of result of claim or response since XXXX. I did however receive a response for the {$160.00} amount which they stated was a permanent credit. I called the bank on XXXX to check status again. and once again they submitted claim incorrectly, did nt notify me whatsoever of any result or update or phone call for that matter. My account got closed for the - {$500.00} amount that resulted from that charge when they reversed the temp credit prior to getting my rebuttal and proof of duplicate charge. They were notified, provided every document from me and makes no sense how XXXX transactions for the same thing same stay at hotel and same charge on my XXXX XXXX can be refunded for XXXX but not the XXXX when there all the same issue. 
Credit reporting;I have contacted Equifax over XXXX times concerning this issue  they say that I am being verified electronically however I informed them that the information is incorrect and that I was not in FL when the supposed medical bills occured. They refuse to remove the negative info from my credit report. All of the other credit agencies have removed these doctor bills as the company couldnt prove conclusively it was me. Equifax is refusing to cooperate. This has been going on for over a year. 
Credit reporting;I disputed an account. I received a response stating that it was deleted. I had someone pull a tri-merge credit report on my after receiving the results, and the account was still on my credit with the credit bureau that stated it was deleted. 
Debt collection;XXXX of XXXX and XXXX NJ is coming after me for a debt we went to Supreme Court In XXXX XXXX NY in XX/XX/XXXX. THEY were not awarded the judge ent and they are also a third party collector for a debt that goes back to XX/XX/XXXX?

Mortgage;[ Summary ] 1. My property tax deposit on escrow account statement is incorrect ( 30 % more ). I submitted all required documents to request the correction but no response was received and no correction action was taken. 2. My property tax due on XX/XX/XXXX was not disbursed from my escrow account. I had to pay property tax plus penalty myself to avoid adverse actions from local authority. 3. I requested a cancellation of my escrow account and was denied by the mortgage service company by terms that were never disclosed to me. [ Detail ] I refinanced my property in XX/XX/XXXX. I realized the property tax deposit amount in my escrow account statement was incorrect ( $ XXXX/month in the statement, $ XXXX/month from city s property tax assessment ). I contacted the mortgage service company XX/XX/XXXX and was advised that I need to submit a written letter together with city s property tax assessment to correct this issue. I followed the instruction and faxed all documents to the number provided by the customer service representative over the phone. Despite I followed all requirements, I never received a response or correction since then. I believe that this is a clear violation of U.S. code 2605 ( e ) ( 1 )  Notice of receipt of inquiry  and U.S. code 2605 ( e ) ( 2 )  Action with respect to inquiry . My XXXX property tax payment due was XX/XX/XXXX, there was not payment disbursed from my escrow account. I found out that I was late on the payment on XX/XX/XXXX, to avoid any potential adverse actions from local government, I had to pay the property tax due plus a {$4.00} late payment interest myself. I believe this is a violation of U.S. Code 2605 ( g )  Administration of escrow accounts . As a result, I contacted my mortgage service company on XX/XX/XXXX to request a cancellation on my escrow account and a refund of escrow account balance. I also stated the recent late payment issue. I received a letter from the mortgage service company today, the company did not response to my statement regarding the late payment or any remediation. It simply declined my request of cancelling my escrow account because1. The Loan to Value Ratio must be below 80 %. 2. The Loan must have 12 months of good payment history. 3. Taxes and insurance that are due within the next 60 days will not be applicable for an escrow deletion. 4. All XXXX must maintain escrow according to the approved HUD-1 statement signed at closing. All these terms was never disclosed to me before of after my closing. I agreed to signed up an escrow account during closing despite my Loan to Value Ratio is far less than 80 %, but there was no disclosure of such terms neither did I sign any document to accept these terms. I believe the mortgage service company and title company are obligated to disclose this information if it is against me, which it serves now. Also by holding my escrow account and imposing a monthly charge without any disbursement, the mortgage service company not only violates U.S. Code 2605 ( g ) but also RESPA cushion limit. The total balance in my escrow account is far more than XXXX annual property tax due. 
Debt collection;I have completed all payments, but it still shows as an open collection on my credit report. 
Credit card;When I logged on to my Macy s account I paid the balance in full but had made a purchase that did nt reflect on my loan balance at the time of pay-off. I called the creditor and I asked them why did nt I receive a statement or a courtesy call and if they would remove the 30 day late off my account as I m in the process of buying a new home. I was told my statements went to an email account that I have nt had in 8 years. I asked what their process was when the statement is rejected by the address and was told nothing. I believe they need to update their system to show all outstanding balances and have a better process to notify their card holders of any returned electronic statements. This is very disappointing news as my mortgage rate will now go from a 4 % to a 4.875, I have since cancelled my credit card with Macy s. 
Debt collection;National Commercial Services sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX alleging I owed them approximated {$320.00} and alleged my XXXX. I do not believe my XXXX.

Bank account or service;A IRA account was transferred to Bank of America. A transfer trustee Direct Rollover Request Form was filled out naming his spouse as beneficiary. XXXX XXXX XXXX sent a certified check to Bank of America reading Pay to the order of B of A Cust for husband. Bank of America issued a deposit slip dated XXXX/XXXX/14 for a deposit of {$30000.00} into an IRA account naming Bank of America as Cust for husband. Husband XXXX and wife is attempting to secure the funds. Bank of America claims they did not negotiate the check despite the fact the wife has a copy of the check and the deposit slip. Check was sent to Bank of America in the name of Bank of America cust for husband. Wife can not secure information regarding the check since she is not named on the check. Bank of America was named on the check issued a deposit slip and is asking the wife to jump thru impossible hoops to secure {$30000.00} plus interest that was deposited in Bank of America on XXXX XXXX, 2014. 
Debt collection;I have requested proof of the debt they claim that originated in 2012 in from a medical visit at XXXX XXXX XXXX.

Mortgage;On or about XXXX XXXX I applied for a modification with Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC on one of my Rental Properties. All paperwork i submitted clearly told them the property was a rental property and I did not occupy the home. On or about XXXX XXXX, I was advised that I was approved for a modification and they required me to make ( XXXX ) reduced payments for the periods XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. The paperwork they sent stated that if I made the payments on time the loan would be modified. I made each prior to the due date and they were all on time and sent them Certified Mail after my third payment I contacted Ocwen and they stated I should continue to make the reduced payments and expect my paperwork be adjusted and a final documents sent to me. On or about XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received another modification letter that said I needed to make the payment for XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX.It also stated in error that I certified it was an owner occupied property. I immediately contacted Ocwen regarding the owner occupied error and payment error and they said to sign the paperwork and send the paperwork in and they would correct it. I was also told to continue making my payments. I sent the paperwork in Certified Mail and continued making my payments via US Certified Mail. Each month my payments were sent in before the due date for the following month. On or about XXXX XXXX, I received a letter form Ocwen stating they are returning my payment because it did not satisfy the Re-Reinstatement amount. On or about XXXX XXXX I sent the next payment in which crossed their letter in the mail and it was cashed. On or about XXXX XXXX, I sent another payment in which they returned. I contacted Ocwen in XXXX XXXX when I received the letter and was told they had not received the paperwork. I forwarded them a copy of the Certified Mail Receipt stating that they did in fact receive it in XXXX XXXX and they stated because they lost it they never received and to resign the paperwork and re-send it. On or about XXXX XXXX, I resent the paperwork via Certified Mail. Each month Ocwen sent me a loan statement reflecting a acceleration of the debt. I did not hear anything from Ocwen other than the above loan statements until XXXX XXXX, when the loan statement indicated I was now delinquent {$9000.00} and the loan was subject to foreclosure. Within two days, I received a letter signed XXXX/XXXX/XXXX form Ocwen saying my modification was approved. The approved modification had the page removed that I crossed out owner occupied and marked non owner occupied, and now they state the loan is delinquent. 
Mortgage;In the process of refinancing my home mortgage. My refinancing company called and faxed Green Tree Mortgage to get payoff. Green Tree never responded with payoff in writing for my refinancing company to complete my new loan. When I contacted Green Tree by phone to request payoff, I was told my account was flagged and they could not talk to me about any details. When asked to know reasons for this situation, I was told to have my lawyer talk to their lawyer. This is my own account, why do I have to hire a lawyer to talk to their lawyer. My account is in good standing  no late payments until now as I was advised not to pay XXXX that it would be rolled into the new loan. I sent XXXX payment to Green Tree today XXXX XXXX by on line banking as Green Tree refused to take payment by phone or allow me to do on line within their Green Tree system. I was told by Green Tree that if I did not pay by 30 days that it would go on my credit rating for seven years. My refinancing of my new loan is at a standstill without any explanation from Green Tree. I also faxed Green Tree to state what was going on my my account. No response. I sent message to Customer service within their Green Tree system. No response. 
Student loan;XXXX at XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ( Closed due to Fraud ) Below is the letter I sent to the President : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXPresident and Chief Executive OfficerAmerican Education ServicesXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXI am writing you with a very heavy heart. I am extremely disheartened and dissatisfied with the level of insensitivity and lack of understanding and communications received from American Education Services  ( AES ) representatives regarding my account. I am requesting immediate release of financial responsibility for the above-mentioned account regarding payment for an educational/discipline program at the XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). It is evidence that XXXX is  not  an accredited educational establishment. However, when I took out this loan, I was told that they were. I have struggled with this loan from the very beginning and have spoken with numerous representatives over the years concerning my hardships : XXXX being financial and the other a divorce. However, I only received temporary relief and a larger outstanding balance. Additional information : I have attached documentation from the Attorney General s office that confirms XXXX was a  Fraud . On XXXX XXXX, XXXX AIR was ordered by the State of XXXX to pay civil penalties of {$250000.00} to the Attorney General s office for issuing unauthorized high school diplomas. The program was furthered order to make partial refunds to parents ( I never received such a refund ), stop issuing diplomas, and stop marketing itself as an accredited school. XXXX applied for permission to issue diplomas from the XXXX State Department of Education and was denied permission on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The Department, in its rejection letter to XXXX, stated that it had determined XXXX was primarily a behavior-modification facility and not a boarding school. A lawsuit against XXXX for issuing fake diplomas was also filed and a judge upheld its validity in XXXX XXXX. These incidents are what led XXXX s enrollment to drop from approximately XXXX students to less than XXXX, and ultimately led to its closing. I too think that is was unjust for American Education Services not to notify me of such allegations and continued to accept payments from me. I am asking that you have compassion, thereby eliminating my outstanding debt as well as send communications to all credit bureaus to have them remove the item as well. Thank you kindly for your consideration, time and immediate attention to this matter.

I cancelled my account they takes debits from. I m now receiving calls after calls from delbert services attempting to get payment. Each time they call I block the number and they call from another number. They are calling from all over the world.

I obtained the order off Professional Regulation stating that Western Sky and its affiliates is ordered to cease and decease. I tried disputing Delbert Services off my credit report which they stated they have reason to believe the debt was mine. I never received a loan from Delbert Services it was transferred from Western Sky whom was not legit. Please help me. Thank you.

Mortgage;Since my layoff over 2 years ago I have repeated attempted to work with Chase regarding mortgage assistance. Initially I was told I did not qualify while receiving unemployment. In XXXX XXXX I submitted a request for modification assistance on line. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I faxed the documentation requested to apply for the modification programXX/XX/XXXX I accepted the repayment plan via phone. I explained I was driving but if necessary I would stop at a location to fax the documentation. I was told no problem fax it tomorrow, we have documented your acceptance. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I.faxed documentationWhen I asked the available agent about the details repayment plan, the XXXX woman told me she did not have any details on the terms of the loan modification that I would have to make the XXXX trial payments first then they would send me details after with the terms to sign. The next agent, a male, said I was 70 days late and the first payment would be almost {$2000.00}, then approximately {$1500.00} for the next 5 months. He explained I should see the documents in the mail in the next week.My primary contact is XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX Ext XXXX. Since my acceptance I have not received a call back from XXXX, despite the fact that I would call her XXXX, leave a voice message, then call back and speak to the next available agent. I have called repeatedly since then trying to get information ( see phone logs. ) Each agent tells me something different and ensures me that they are making notes, documents are on their way and I should be getting a call back. Recently I received a foreclosure notice and called about it, an agent explained it was an automated system and this was pretty standard but as long as I was working with them, there would be no foreclosure proceedings. I asked if I could make a payment on more than XXXX occasion and was told no, not until the repayment plan was in place. That their system would not accept a payment. I was assured the documents were on their way. I have repeatedly been denied the option to make any payments until their system allows it. Last month I received documents for a 40 year loan term period ( currently I have 18 years left to pay. ) I was told the interest rate would remain the same. I questioned why anyone would spread XXXX payments ( initially, now XXXX payments ) over 22 years? I explained I would be XXXX years old and probably dead. I reiterated I signed the acceptance for a repayment plan and would like to know what and when I need to pay. Again I was told XXXX will call me. I also explained I would only consider a modification if the interest rate were reduced. At XXXX point I was told that the process was closed out XXXX and they could help me reapply. I get the distinct impression that each agent works on commission. I was extremely frustrated and started asking for a supervisor or manager. Since then, I have been working with escalations at XXXX. I was told that the repayment plan has been resubmitted and now the XXXX payment with be {$4000.00}. I questioned why I was being penalized because they could not get the process in place. I feel like I m being force into either accepting the 40 year term or losing my home which I ve been paying on since XXXX. I questioned why they refuse to work with me by either reducing the interest rate for a 20 or 30 year loan or spreading the payments over the 6 months instead of demanding {$4000.00} at once. Each agent avoided my questions and changed the subject. I decided to do a little research. I came across http : //www.consumeraffairs.com/finance/chase_mortgage.html where the majority of comments are eerily similar. This seems highly immoral to me and might even be criminal. The problem is Chase knows each individual is already experiencing a hardship, having little to no recourse. All while their credit plummets. 
Credit reporting;I am having difficulty trying to file for a credit card or to receive a credit card due to that I have a XXXX brother with the same last name and same first but our middle names are different. our social security numbers are different by XXXX digit cause we were born XXXX as XXXX. XXXX are XXXX individual people, not XXXX person. When trying to file for a credit card, the credit bureau s see XXXX different social security numbers but when they see the same first and last name, everything is refered back to XXXX person and only being XXXX person since having the same names but the system ca nt detect a XXXX digit difference in social security numbers. The United States XXXX can Identify XXXX separate human beings with XXXX different social security numbers and see the complete name, first, middle and last, they do nt see only first and last name. This problem has been going on for the last 7 years and yet to this day credit bureau s have not identified or tried to prevent these kind of situations believing that XXXX people with the same fist and last name but XXXX digit difference in social security is still only XXXX person. Were both veterans, we have XXXX different XXXX discharge papers, both identifying both of us as XXXX different people. I hope that the system is nt discriminating towards Hispanics that have identical names but yet XXXX different social security numbers. 
Consumer Loan;I went to XXXX XXXX in XXXX, AZ to purchase a vehicle. I previously purchased a vehicle 8 years ago when it was XXXX XXXX. But, I did not have a good experience with a recent purchase. The salesman, XXXX XXXX, was misleading in the information he gave me about the financing and refinancing of the vehicle. The vehicle was more than XXXX XXXX XXXX value as confirmed by my bank and another dealer. I could not get alternate financing for the vehicle because of it. Now I am in a vehicle with extremely high financing rate and payments that I can not afford. I told XXXX several times I wanted to wait to get things straight with the bank and was pressured to move forward with the deal based on information he told me about the financing and refinancing of the vehicle. The purchase was made on XXXX/XXXX/15 and when we called on XXXX/XXXX/15 and went there we were told that the Manager ( who I assume is XXXX XXXX ) would not approve of taking the vehicle back. The circumstances and dealings with XXXX XXXX are shady and not very honorable. I have contacted the finance company which is Credit Acceptance as well as the Office of the Attorney General to file a complaint. There was also hidden damage on the vehicle under the front license plate. This was not seen since they had their dealership plate covering the damage. XXXX XXXX uses Credit Acceptance as a finance company for their sales. They force deals on you with Credit Acceptance by doing the  verification  process and they receive direct funding in day as stated by XXXX XXXX who ( owner/salesman of XXXX ) and is a  featured dealer  on the Credit Acceptance website for advertising purposes. They asked for my bank statements. pay stubs, etc. that very day so they could get paid immediately and the deal is funded. This completes the verification process and assures that XXXX will be paid immediately on their deal regardless if they have misrepresented information or used predatory sales/credit practices. Credit Acceptance s  Portfolio Program  that XXXX participated in allows them to receive an up-front profit and to share in collections. The owner/salesman XXXX XXXX will do everything possible to close the deal to the point of falsifying most everything he can to put you in a car with the highest interest rates he can because of the funding he receives from Credit Acceptance. I have contacted Credit Acceptance on XXXX/XXXX/15, XXXX/XXXX/15, XXXX/XXXX/15 with regard to this situation. No one has returned my calls ( including XXXX XXXX -- XXXX ). I sent a complaint also to Credit Acceptance s customer service to get this resolved and have not received any contact. My bank, XXXX, has temporarily issued a credit for the deposit that I put down but that is until they complete their own investigation so it may not be permanent. XXXX XXXX was stalling on the deal to with me telling that he had already been paid/funded ( XXXX/XXXX/15 ). There was nothing I could do about it because the Credit Acceptance contract would not cancelled/revocable once accepted. We tried again on XXXX/XXXX/15 to return the vehicle and was told by XXXX that he would have it towed if we left it there. I have contacted my financial institution, Credit Acceptance, XXXX, FTC, AZ Attorney General, and a local TV station to assistant with this situation to get an acceptable resolution. 
Mortgage;Dear CFPB Representaive ( s )  First, thank you for making the platform for delivery of complaints accessible via the internet, and for making it so user-friendly. My drama began approximately seven years ago when Ocwen Loan Servicing began servicing my home loan. Still recovering from the impact of XXXX XXXX and a direct strike from a XXXX born out of the storm, the Mortgage Crisis was beginning. Michigan XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and finally Ocwen, each, took over my home loan. Somewhere in the process my loan was put into a 30-year fixed loan. That was the good news. But, despite my pleas to handle my property tax and hazard premium payment myself, Ocwen demanded escrowing the funds. My town - XXXX XXXX, LA - requires property tax payments at the beginning of the year instead of year-end, like most municipalities. Despite repeated letters to Ocwen, my property taxes began accruing interest and penalties, and finally, after many years of letter writing warning Ocwen about the potential problem, I discovered Ocwen had nt even been paying my property taxes at all. And, my home and property were sold at a Tax Sale. ( attachment ) Only last month, in XX/XX/XXXX, did I finally find a change to my escrow account on Ocwen s webpage. The glaring and abrupt increase in my escrow account and the increase in my monthly mortgage payment were tell-tale signs something had changed for the worse. And, to make matters worse, my home suffered a total loss from a fire on XX/XX/XXXX. A plug-in fragrance and night light device was the cause. But, already losing my home and most of my possessions to this fire, I was forced to continue arguing with Ocwen Loan Servicing about the Delinquent Tax Bills they had not paid, but they had escrowed my payments for over the years. In other words, they took my payments for XXXX XXXX, but Ocwen did nt pay the taxes. Then, the last straw was laid upon my already stressed existence. Ocwen withheld proceeds from my Hazard Premium for over thirty days from receipt of my funds. Ocwen played game after game slowing the release of even one dollar to help me rebuild my home. Had it not been for an XXXX, we would have suffered nearly 90-days with nothing. Still today, I have to argue constantly with Ocwen to release funds for reconstruction. And with 92 % of the work complete, only 66 % of the funds have been released. Today is XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX. Nearly seven months and still Ocwen withholds funds. About three weeks ago, Ocwen Loss Department called me to inquire about my percentage of completion of construction from the fire. We agreed they should send an inspector right away. The inspector showed up last week, but she forgot to bring the paperwork. Three days later she emailed me requesting I print he email, sign the form, scan the document and email it back. Perhaps, not having experienced a total loss from fire, she did nt realize fires do nt leave one s computers and printers functional. Looking at the number of documents Ocwen required before release of XXXX penny of the Insurance proceeds, some docs requiring notorization then discarded by Ocwen as unimportant, one ca nt imagine the burdeon placed on victims by their mortgage companies. But, I ve never heard of a mortgage company being as heartless as Ocwen. I know the documents were useless because despite everything I returned, Ocwen asked for other documents which were nt even in the original packet of docs that needed to be completed. Ocwen just wanted to hold the funds, Recently, it was newsworthy that Ocwen s CEO stepped down from his lofty perch. I used to think my problems with Ocwen were somewhat unique, but once the news broke I learned that Ocwen had been hurting many, many others. More 
Mortgage;I am writing because I agreed to allow XXXX be my home insurance provider in XXXX XXXX at a set quote of total around {$1300.00} for XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XXXX XXXX, XXXX hired a XXXX party to do an  inspection  or  to access  my house. The XXXX party did not do a good job and misled XXXX on my insurance policy. XXXX then increased my policy to more than XXXX of what it was, without due process not notifying me. This has caused for my insurance company to add an additional {$200.00} per month to my mortgage per month, for the period of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am about to go into foreclosure because of this. I have contacted XXXX since I received the XXXX party evaluation and they refuse to correct this. The evaluation stated that I have XXXX garages and XXXX doors and other mistakes which led XXXX to believe that they should XXXX the policy. However, the evaluation also included pictures of my house which proved otherwise. I have contacted XXXX and they are telling me that based upon the sq footage that they received from the XXXX party that my policy was wrong, but I was not told of this from XXXX until XXXX XXXX. I need a refund of the  new amount . 
Mortgage;Ocwen financial services claims simultaneously to have a loan with me ( despite my never having done business with them or having been notified of said loan ) and to have written off said loan with the IRS in XX/XX/XXXX. Further, they continue to insert themselves in a legal case I have against XXXX XXXX XXXX company regarding my foreclosure. Ocwen has claimed in a legal deposition that they are the current holder of an unsigned original, legally executed Note. XXXX has claimed that the holder of the note is the owner of the property. However, Ocwen appears to have discharged the Note according to the IRS. This Note was discharged previously by IndyMac Mortgage Services in XX/XX/XXXX ( which Ocwen is aware of as the evidence of this was shown to them at a legal deposition ). Ocwen appears to have applied a court ordered use and occupancy payment made out to XXXX to a loan ( number XXXX XXXX which Ocwen pretends to have with me. I have received no notification that any loan was transferred to Ocwen at any time, nor could this have happened since Ocwen was not ( and does not claim ) any involvement until long after a foreclosure had already taken place on the property. Further, Ocwen did not ( according to their own testimony at deposition ) become holder of any Note or Loan through the purchase of the assets of IndyMac Mortgage Services from XXXX ( or any other entity ), rather, they claim this happened as a result of XXXX giving them an original copy of a legally executed Note where it was held in a vault from the time of foreclosure. These very facts are in dispute in a court of law at the moment and the case is pending appeal. In filing a tax for claiming to discharge a note that they did not had and had been previously discharged, Ocwen is guilty of tax fraud against the IRS. In claiming to have a loan with me and/or attached to my property, Ocwen is committing fraud. If Ocwen is claiming to have a loan with me, I was never notified of this fact as required by federal law and I dispute any such claim. By assigning a payment to a loan which does nt exist, Ocwen is committing fraud, since they simultaneously claim that they discharged the debt last year and the check was not made out to Ocwen Financial it s parent or subsidiary or related companies which constitutes check fraud. Further, Ocwen is violating the court order for use and occupancy, which they are not entitled to since they are not part of the legal action. Further, Ocwen is clearly conspiring with XXXX and is costing me money. Finally, Ocwen was previously notified of their tax fraud by registered letter, so they are already aware ( or should be aware ) that their behavior is inappropriate and likely illegal. 
Debt collection;I have been contacting XXXX, XXXX, & XXXX for over a year to have them remove the  open  collections that clearly states it was discharged thru my bankruptcy. XXXX has since removed these from my credit. However XXXX and XXXX has then reporting as  open  not only that I am showing XXXX collections for the same debt that was discharged. I ve made several attempts to have these removed from showing open collections with no results, except from XXXX. I understand these are in my bankruptcy, however they are not  OPEN . I have been discharged from these. 
Bank account or service;On Friday XXXX/XXXX/2015, my check account said that check # XXXX in the amount of {$50.00} was paid and that I had a balance of {$24.00}. Therefore I assumed that the check was paid as they listed it as being paid. Today XXXX/XXXX/2015 my account shows as being overdrawn. I was charged a fee of {$12.00} and had {$50.00} removed from my savings account. I have been with the bank U.S Bank for many years and my bank has never been misleading. I feel that I was misled. 
Mortgage;I filed a complaint with the CFPB on XXXX/XXXX/15 concerning trouble I am having with my loan servicer, Ocwen Loan Servicing. In it, I detailed many problems I am having with their latest loan modification offer and gave reasons why it is totally unacceptable. ( Case number : XXXX ). Their loan modification gives me until XXXX XXXX to make my XXXX payment, but in their response to my complaint, they say they will not respond to it until XXXX XXXX, and to check back in as many as 60 days to see their response. As you can see, this is a problem, as in my complaint I have asked Ocwen to reconsider these XXXX terms and unsustainable monthly payment amount to something that is more reasonable. If they are unable or unwilling to respond to my complaint in a timely manner, than I ask that Ocwen extend the time for me to make my XXXX payment until XXXX XXXX, which is the same amount of time they are saying in which they will get around to responding to my complaint. 
Mortgage;In XXXX XX/XX/2015 my wife & I were pre-qualified for a new primary residence home mortgage through Bank of America. We found a home we wanted to purchase & on XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/2015 our offer on a new home was accepted by the sellers with a close date of XXXX. We immediately forwarded all the information to BofA to start the loan process. We provided all information that the bank requested and responded to them with any additional document requests the same day they requested them. Our closing date came & went and they only explanation we were provided was that our file was very complicated. On Tuesday XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/2015 we were finally told that our loan had been 100 % approved. On Wednesday XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/2015 the bank then informed me that not only was the loan not approved yet, but they wanted an additional {$140000.00} of liquid assets in order to close. After speaking with the bank, they then amended the requirement to {$15000.00}. I was able to come up with the additional assets that they required the same day & now it is Friday XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/2015 and I still have no answers from the bank other than the file is in underwriting. 
Student loan;I attended XXXX XXXX, a XXXX school, and was encouraged to apply for a Genesis student loan with the understanding I would have a XXXX high paying job. After over XXXX months looking for a job as a XXXX I am working XXXX hours a week @ {$XXXX} an hour and have over {$9000.00} in student loan debt. I do not believe I was given honest information and the loan was not reasonable for me to take out. 
Credit card;In XXXX, 2015, Bank of America performed an update to their systems ( as per the representative at Bank of America ). The representative explained that as a result of the update, this caused XXXX and stored sources of customer payments ( such as checking accounts ) to be erased. I was not aware of this issue until I received a notice from Bank of America that XXXX of my credit card accounts payments was past due. It ended up being the account I had set up on auto-pay years earlier, and the payments were always made on time ( the amount of payments above the minimum payment amount ). When I called Bank of America customer service number at XXXX about the late fees they assessed, they directed me to call their auto pay department at XXXX. I contacted the auto-pay number and spoke to XXXX. He advised me he would be able to reverse the {$25.00} fee. 
Mortgage;Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Case # XXXX and Case # XXXX have already been reported. I am NJ Statewide Foreclosure Case Docket # XXXX and Statewide Foreclosure Case Docket # XXXX. I do not have a lawyer for either case because it was a Washington Mutual Loan where Washington Mutual was not the loan originator. Therefore, the is no financial instrument record in the government offices stating Washington Mutual had a legal right to collect on the original mortgage purchased from the loan originator in XXXX. The XXXX County Bar Association was not taking cases of this nature. All correspondence from the XXXX referenced complaint cases have correspondence from Chase. Chase being  THE BANK . On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, a moving truck with the name  XXXX  pulled into my condominium courtyard where my primary residence is located. The passenger got out of the truck and began walking around the building. I have my computer and desk where I read the newspaper and do daily work in a position where I can view the street below my unit. The driver and the passenger of the truck proceeded to my front door where they tried to enter the locked door. They tried to break-in. When I requested that they stop, I answered the door, and I requested they hand me over paperwork and names and numbers of whom hired them. The driver and the passenger of the moving truck refused to provide the information. I was handed a sticker with a telephone number on it, and they stated that telephone number had all the information. The telephone number on the sticker is XXXX. The driver and passenger claimed they were from  The Bank  called XXXX. According to the complaints, I should be dealing with JP Morgan Chase or Chase, as it states on all the correspondence I am receiving from the complaints I filed. The driver and the passenger of the moving truck smelled like they had nt bathed in about a week, and they tried to gain entry to my unit via the front door at XXXX on a Monday morning. The driver and the passenger had no identification on them from their employer. I have the sticker they gave me. I was never notified of pending visit. The moving truck driver and passenger had no paperwork for the visit. The moving truck driver and passenger could nt provide in writing their names, number, and the company where they were employed. The moving truck driver and passenger driving a green box moving truck with the company name of  XXXX  on the passenger door tried to break-in to my primary residence. Chase did not petition the courts gaining approval to sell the mortgage prior to the sale of the debt instrument in XXXX XXXX while the XXXX Foreclosure proceedings Docket # XXXX for the foreclosure were proceeding, and the courts denied the sale of the debt in XXXX, XXXX. The complaints referenced above are providing correspondence from Chase. XXXX people tried to break-in to my home this morning on XXXX XXXX, XXXX at XXXX, and they both XXXX. The XXXX people refused to provide me information of any kind about who they were and who hired them other than  THE BANK  named XXXX sent them to my primary residence. XXXX is not  The Bank  I or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was corresponding with during the XXXX referenced complaints. 
Mortgage;My wife and I just went through 7 months of application for a HAMP modification with US Bank. I am a XXXX and sometimes do nt have work in the winter months. I got behind a few months on my mortgage payments and was approved for the modification on XXXX, 2015. During this time US Bank kept sending statements for payment, assessing late fees, and making bad reports to the credit bureaus. I spoke with my representative, XXXX XXXX, about the XXXX week of XXXX to tell her I would not be able to make my XXXX payment and that the XXXX may be late. I reminded her of this when I spoke to her at the end of XXXX telling her I expected a paycheck around XXXX XXXX. I did nt get it on the XXXX and called to let her know that as soon as it arrived I was going to send in the past due amounts. I finally got the check on XXXX XXXX. I got a cashiers check for XXXX - XXXX - and XXXX and sent it. I called her the next day to let her know the check was in the mail. We signed and sent the acceptance form for the HAMP modification. About a week later, we received a letter from US Bank saying we were disqualified and not approved for the loan modification. The letter said the reason for the revocation was because the mortgage was no longer delinquent. At no time were we told that paying the past due amounts would get us eliminated from the program. I kept them well informed that I was trying to come up with the funds. Had I known, I would have kept the money and put it toward a new furnace. Ours broke last XXXX and needs to be replaced. We have been trying to keep warm this winter with only a wood stove in the basement. Sometimes it s only XXXX degrees when we get up in the morning. We also need the roof replaced. US Bank says they will not take any responsibility for them tricking us into being disqualified. They claim the modification was figured to include the delinquency and any change to those figures nullifies the deal. I did the fiscally responsible thing by paying when I could  I should not be punished for mistakes they made. 
Credit reporting;I wanted to receive my free annual credit report online. Went to annualcreditreport.com and chose TransUnion as the company to receive my report from. This transferred my request to the TransUnion website where I could only get my report by PAYING {$1.00} for the report and score. {$1.00} is not much but I do not want to give out my credit card information as it has been compromised several times, so I could not use the website. Called TransUnion customer service. They said I could use the phone service ( having to give my Social Security number over a cell phone, not secure either ), or write. If TransUnion will not give the free annual credit report online, then that should be noted via annualcreditreport.com. I believe TransUnion is making it difficult to get a free credit report on purpose. Please investigate. 
Student loan;JP Morgan owes my student loan # XXXX but their servicer XXXX XXXX XXXX changed my due date from the XXXX which I had for several years was changed without my permission to the XXXX which will not work my pay cycle all my other loans are due on the XXXX, and I have tried to change it many times but I kept getting told different answers, I do not know why my due date keeps getting changed. I believe that is illegal to go in and change any due dates unless I asked for them to be changed. I have tried to discuss other matters with CHASE but they refuse to discuss anything with me, they are still responsible for any actions that XXXX takes on loans because they still own this debt, if XXXX does not get its act together I may have file bankruptcy and that way no one would get anything. It is difficult to get a bankruptcy that includes student loans but based on the numerous actions taken by XXXX, I may not have a choice. I have a controlled XXXX XXXX XXXX but everything I talk to XXXX, my XXXX XXXX level goes up, I had to go to the emergency XXXX night because of them. My doctor advised me to have them contact me by email only because talking to them is no longer a good option. XXXX XXXX is a known liar and will not take the time to actually investigate a complaint, I have filed numerous complaints inside XXXX and I do not hear anything. Chase has a part in this also, they think because they do not do anything with the loans, they do not have talk with me but that is not true. Per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, you have a duty to deal with the complaints, you will only contact XXXX for their side of the story which is not a real way to solve a complaint. XXXX is a horrible servicer and I wish not to deal with them anymore and would rather file bankruptcy so I can have a healthier life. 
Mortgage;I been trying to do a loan modification with Chase, I have applied in the past, but I have not been successful because of my income. This time they do nt want to even look at the my application even thou my financial situation is different that it was when I first applied, they refused to review the application, I think that is not fair to people. 
Consumer Loan;On XXXX XXXX i purchased a leased suv from XXXX. After going over contract discovered down payment amounts i never agreed to within XXXX mins i asked for refund but was refused. After looking at numerous vehicles from XXXX different stores i finally decided on a XXXX. By XXXX the following day i was broke down on the roadside after working a XXXX hr shift.Called to get help and was told i had to pay to get car towed. After confronting manager i asked gor refind again still within my XXXX hrs and the store manager refused .After i threatened to call news station i was put into XXXX. And you guessed it XXXX weeks later this car breaks down i need help i was even still forced to make a car payment after only having the car XXXX weeks 
Credit card;I HAD A CREDIT BALANCE ON MY ACCOUNT OF XXXX CENTS. THIS MONTH MY ACCOUNT WAS CHARGED TO REMOVE THE XXXX CENTS. I CONTACTED CHASE AND WAS TOLD ANY CREDIT BALANCE UNDER XXXX ( XXXX - XXXX ) WOULD BE ADJUSTED AND RETAINED BY CHASE AS INTEREST IF NOT USED WITH 60 DAYS. I WAS NOT OFFERED A CREDIT BY CHASE OR ANY SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION. I REVIEWED MY ACCOUNT OPENING MATERIALS AND COULD NOT FIND ANYWHERE THAT STATED THEY CAN KEEP MY CREDIT IF I DO NT USE IT WITH 60 DAYS. XXXX CENTS IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY, HOWEVER WHEN YOU HAVE XXXX CUSTOMERS IN XXXX STATES XXXX - XXXX CENTS CAN ADD UP TO XXXX DOLLARS IN UNDESERVED PROFITS TO THE BANK THAT DOES NOT BELONG TO THEM. TO ME THIS APPEARS TO BE THEFT BY CHASE BANK AND XXXX CUSTOMERS ARE BEING DECEIVED  BECAUSE TO MOST PEOPLE PENNIES DO NT MATTER. PLEASE INVESTIGATE. 
Consumer Loan;I started contacting Hyundai Motor Finance on XXXX XXXX, requesting payments applied to my principal balance. Each time I was informed it would take XXXX days to be processed. I called XXXX times in the past month requesting to have the XXXX payments adjusted as instructed by the HMF representatives. As of today XXXX XXXX, only XXXX payment has been applied to the principal & I keep getting promised that they will be escalated & corrected. I have refinanced my vehicle and have been charged excess interest due to the previous payments not being applied to the principal balance, in combination with HMF not being accessible for close to a week due to incliment weather & having to wait to receive the payoff information. I feel HMF has dragged out the completion of correcting my payments in hopes to continue charging more for interest. I would not refer HMF to anyone looking for good and trust-worthy customer service. 
Credit card;Complaint Against : Wells Fargo Financial National BankI was charged a {$25.00} late fee on a {$500.00} remaining balance for paying {$120.00} well ahead of the due date but not covering the full  minimum  payment of approximately {$190.00}. When I explained the details of the situation, they did not acknowledge the best effort I made to be current and refused to waive the fees since in their determination it was not a Wells Fargo Error. The fee is unfair, and their choice to not waive the fee was a horrible busines practice and abusive in nature as it rested on  There is no beneift to us having to waive the fee  Bankground Details : In XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a hot tup and took advantage of a dealer finance option that used a Wells Fargo Outdoor Solution credit card to provide XXXX months interest free financing. The total amount financed was approximately {$5500.00}. On XXXX I paid XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX I paid {$2500.00} and knew there was a {$500.00} remaining balance. Given I had XXXX months interest free financing, I just diveded by XXXX and set my bill pay to send {$120.00} each month. On XXXX my XXXX {$120.00} payment was made. When I got a collection notice it showed the payment received but a late charge of {$25.00}. I immediately paid all the remaining principle of {$370.00} on XXXX and currently have a {$25.00} balance made exclusively of the fee. When I contacted Wells Fargo at XXXX they transferred me. The rep I spoke to spoke to his supervisor XXXX times about my situation and XXXX times said he could not waive the fee even after I explained the situation. When I asked to file a complaint, the rep was nt aware of anyway to file a complaint. He offered for me to speak with his supervisor. I spoke with supervisor  XXXX  who said she would file a payment dispute. She continued to say they would not waive the fee as Wells Fargo did nt make an error. She kept saying they send out statements and that I just need to read them. My main point of frustation and complaint is that I was paying at an accelerated rate and made a best faith attempt to not only be current but pay more than required. What I failed to realize, is even though the account has credit card access they based the minumum payment on 3.5 % of the ORIGINAL balance. My accelerated payments did nt do anything to change the minimum on what I thought was a credit card account. Because I planned out my payment strategy up front, I did nt look at the billing as they came and did nt realize their unusual therefore to a small extent deceptive minimum payment process. When I asked how frequently they get these issues, they would not answer, which makes me think it is fairly common. I sincerely believe there is an ongoing business practice to extract fees from otherwise interest free accounts without regard to customer concern or reasonable waiver policies. They went as far to partially blame current regulatory environment for not allowing discretionary waivers. My hope with this complaint is to get the {$25.00} fee waived if possible, but more importantly to ensure Wells Fargo Financial National Bank is required to have a better complaint program than they seem to. They only took the billing dispute when I made them and did not know about any complaint program. Then to make matters worse the billing dispute can take XXXX days - my balance would have been paid off for over XXXX days by that point. They do nt need 60 days. 
Credit card;There were XXXX unauthorized charges on my chase credit card account. I contacted Chase and initially they credited my account while they were doing their investigation. Later after about 2 months they told me that the charges were valid and charged my account. But I have told them over and over the charges were not mine and I never authorized the charges. The person who made the charges has a totally different name, living in a different state! I do nt know the person, I never authorized the person and I have no idea how that person used my Chase account number to subscribe to XXXX! Since XXXX XXXX, 2015, I have sent chase XXXX messages ( through their online customer service ) telling them again and again that the charges were not mine and every time they say they are looking at my issue and will get back to me in 2-3 days, but they never do. 
Credit reporting;I was trying to verify my identity in order to rent an apartment. However, I failed the identity verification XXXX via phone. Although, I have answered the questions correctly, I somehow managed to fail my own identity. I wrote down the questions and the answer choices given to me, and there were a few answer choices that came out on both phone calls -- I am assuming those are the  correct  answers that they were looking for, although they were all false. 
Student loan;In order to pay for XXXX XXXX, I took out loans with XXXX XXXX ( as well as State/Federal ). I, like many others I ve heard from, have had difficulties communicating with XXXX XXXX representatives and getting good information. I have requested information from XXXX XXXX regarding how my minimum payment is calculated and about the history of my loan balances and how they have changed over time pursuant to the amounts I ve paid - e.g. how much was applied to interest vs. principal. I have been told this information is too difficult to gather ... and that the XXXX format of the information is difficult to translate into an email or letter. I had a sneaking suspicion that the minimum amounts to pay each month and they way they were being allocated were sub-optimal for me. Similarly, I requested an amortization schedule from them so I could get an idea of how my loan balances should reduce over time. I was told this was impossible because of my variable interest rates ... however, all of my loans through XXXX XXXX have fixed interest rates. A follow-up communication by me on the matter was not replied to. When I plug in my XXXX XXXX loan information ( principal balances, interest rates ) into Amortization calculators on the internet ( designed for mortgages ), I get different minimum payment figures than what XXXX XXXX provides, which furthers my distrust. I have included a PDF from XXXX XXXX that shows their answer to my aforementioned question, which includes the element about my loans and their variable interest rates. Again, my loans have fixed interest rates. Are these unreasonable requests? And how should I best approach the matters? XXXX of the reasons I decided to refinance recently was not just to save money, but also to not have to deal with XXXX XXXX anymore. Thanks! 
Credit card;On XXXX/XXXX/15, I received an e-mail statement from Bank of America s Online Banking, stating I have a payment due on XXXX/XXXX/15 for {$99.00}. On XXXX/XXXX/15, the same day I received the email statement, I made the payment of {$99.00} and it posted to my account on XXXX/XXXX/15. On XXXX/XXXX/15, and on numerous dates thereafter, I contacted BOA via chat and telephone, to inquire as to why it was still showing that I still had a payment due on XXXX/XXXX/15 for {$99.00}. I was informed that BOA was making changes to their Online Banking system and that I need not worry and my {$99.00} payment on XXXX/XXXX/15 will be applied to the XXXX/XXXX/15 due date. On XXXX/XXXX/15, I noticed that my account was past due, there was a new payment due immediately for {$98.00}, a {$25.00} late fee for payment due, my card was blocked from use and my credit line was decreased from {$10000.00} to {$8900.00}, as a result of this  delinquency.  All of these penalties occurred without reason and prior notification to me. On XXXX/XXXX/15, I contacted BOA via chat and telephone and after research, it was discovered that it was bank error that my payment for the XXXX/XXXX/15 due date was incorrectly applied in the system and therefore, I received a {$25.00} late charge adjustment. I was then informed that this matter would be immediately rectified and the new payment due immediately for {$98.00} would zero out and I would only have to pay the XXXX/XXXX/15 amount due of {$120.00}. On XXXX/XXXX/15, I noticed that my account was still past due, and now I owed an amount of {$220.00} by XXXX/XXXX/15 ( $ 98+ {$120.00} for XXXX ). I contacted BOA again via chat and telephone and again, was advised this would again be immediately rectified. Not trusting BOA after false information was previously provided to me, I paid both the {$98.00} and the {$120.00} to have my account placed back in good standing, even though it was in good standing and always has been. On XXXX/XXXX/15, I contacted BOA via chat and telephone and inquired again as to why this has nt been rectified and more importantly, to request my previous credit line of {$10000.00} be RESTORED, since the reduction was a result of BOA incorrectly putting my account in delinquency. I was advised that would be impossible without running a new credit report and I declined. I DID NOT REQUEST an INCREASE in my credit line, I requested my credit line be RESTORED, due to BOA s error. Not only did BOA misapply my payment, I had to pay a new payment due immediately for {$98.00}, a {$25.00} late fee for payment due, which was later refunded, my card was blocked from use and my credit line was decreased from {$10000.00} to {$8900.00}, and the refusal to RESTORE it, as a result of BOA s error, is appalling.

I am under alot of stress and I do not need this 
Debt collection;I received this email with an attachment which I do not want to open. They portray themselves as an employment agency with the title for their LLC as  sourcing and Support . This is false pretense & whoever approved the LLC name and nature of business should be fired. Also, there was no option for communication tactics that rules over email communication.

Debt collection;I had a line of credit with Bank of America. I left the account at a zero balance when I closed the account. I received a notification that I had a balance. I disputed the account but I was unable to provide proof because it was and old account. I called and I was told that if I pay the full amount that the account will be taken off my credit report. I paid however, I requested all documents with my account activities since I opened the account to verify where the error was and to proof that it was my mistake or not and I have not yet rcvd the documents and the account it s still on my credit report. I called again and I was told that it will remain in my credit report for 7 years for an amount of {$71.00}. Please help. 
Credit reporting;I paid XXXX XXXX Systems back in XXXX. They sent a letter to all XXXX credit bureaus and my wife and I showing that the account was satisfied in full. The problem is that all the credit bureaus are reporting this account in the remark section as  settled for less than full amount . I asked them all to remove the remark from this account. I uploaded and faxed documentation from XXXX XXXX XXXX showing this account was satisfied in full. It s now XXXX, and we are in the final process of getting our first home, and the remark is still showing on our reports. We need to have the remark removed. 
Credit reporting;Equifax is reporting a  hard credit inquiry  from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I told Equifax that ( 1 ) I never asked XXXX for any services  ( 2 ) XXXX does not provide any services in XXXX where I live  ( 3 ) XXXX told me that they have no record of any account or request in my name  and ( 4 ) XXXX told me that they did not make any credit inquiry about me. Nevertheless, despite repeated requests, Equifax refuses to remove the erroneous information and this is adversely affecting my otherwise  excellent  credit score. I have written to Equifax several times, pointing out the absurdity of their report, but they have refused to remove the false item from my credit report ( which, by the way, is not shown on any other report from any other credit reporting agency ). I told Equifax that their inexplicable failure is costing me time and money, and that I would report their misconduct to you, but they do not seem to care. 
Debt collection;Background : In XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX I began falling behind on payments to XXXX XXXX. A substantial balance had accumulated because of recent large unforeseen expenses - vehicle repairs which resulted from our truck being rear-ended. The insurance company unexpectedly denied claims for over XXXX in repairs. We met minimum payments in XXXX XXXX - {$3100.00}, XXXX XXXX - {$3100.00}, XXXX XXXX - {$2300.00}, XXXX XXXX - XXXX, XXXX. XXXX - {$1100.00} and XXXX. {$4300.00}. we were able to meet these obligations only by closing a small IRA and borrowing. The debt situation began to grow serious. The XXXX minimum payment was {$3100.00} and I was unable to pay it. We paid {$500.00}. There were multiple phone calls and conversations with XXXX XXXX. In XXXX I wrote to XXXX requesting that they grant a XXXX month grace period since I had been a customer for over 20 years and had just become eligible for Social Security Benefits ( and would therefore have additional income ). The XXXX SS benefit check would arrive the last week in XXXX and I promised substantial monthly payments from then until the balance was satisfied. I sent a payment of {$1000.00} on XXXX XXXX and, at the end of the XXXX cycle, XXXX XXXX closed the account and sent it to collection. Phone calls from a collection agency began XXXX XXXX, XXXX and repeated multiple times each day. They were all from  unavailable  or  restricted  numbers. My XXXX conversation with a representative at  XXXX  was XXXX XXXX. I sent a letter ( certified return receipt ) requesting that they ceased calling me and send validation / documentation of the debt. I did not receive this documentation so I sent a XXXX request XXXX days later. A short while later ( XXXX XXXX ) I began receiving multiple phone calls from another collection agency, XXXX XXXX XXXX After numerous phone calls ( with a call center in XXXX ) and another letter requesting validation of the debt, I did finally receive the documentation on XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. I then called XXXX and spoke with a representative called, XXXX. We hammered out a verbal agreement. A  settlement  was not possible because of our limited financial resources. I needed to make payments. They wanted at least 10 % down. I wanted to put {$500.00} down. The end result was an agreement of {$890.00} down ( which XXXX stated he was able to achieve under  hardship  conditions ) and monthly payments of {$430.00} for 36 months. Except the agreement had to be in XXXX parts - 24 months was as long as they would go. We would need a XXXX agreement for 12 months for the remaining amount. There would be no additional interest on what I owed. I stated that I would send in my own payments and ( on legal advice ) not provide a bank account number and allow them to take automatic payments. I also wanted our agreement in writing before I would send in the XXXX payment. I requested information on the  clean slate  offer XXXX was making. XXXX directed me to call the credit reporting number at XXXX XXXX since XXXX could not determine how XXXX would report this account. XXXX told me that a letter outlining what we discussed would be sent to me and I should call him when I received it. This was on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I waited a week ( XXXX XXXX ) and emailed my mail service to forward mail. The packet arrived on XXXX XXXX but there was no letter from XXXX. I almost immediately began receiving collection calls from another XXXX #. When I returned the calls I had to start all over with a different office /division of XXXX. I reiterated the terms of the agreement that had been achieved. I dealt with XXXX people at this new office ( XXXX XXXX, then XXXX and finally the  supervisor  XXXX XXXX. They stated that no letter would be sent until I gave them access to my bank account and they had taken the first payment. This was after ( cont. ) 
Consumer Loan;I had an arrangement made with my finance company before my due day I have been getting calls every single day representatives have been calling me disclosing information without confirming who they re speaking with ask to speak with supervisor supervisor called me a liar stated will be calling my human resources manager at my job I did nt ask to speak to a different supervisor to have my complain to listen to representative who I called stated I called a different branch and there was no supervisors available I ask to be transferred he denied due to does nt know XXXX supervisor will beavailable that they are the boss of him and he does nt know their time frame 
Debt collection;I noticed a debt on my credit report, so I contacted the company and wrote a letter disputing the debt as not a valid debt. I waited the 45 days they stated it could take to resolve or investigate the debt, but never received any media from the company and has now taken almost XXXX as long as they company stated and still have not received any letters nor have they removed this debt. 
Mortgage;Attached please find all my supporting documents of regular payments, ON TIME, and the escrows accounts in question. I have been trying to rectify this situation by calling the phone number furnished on the Ocwen document, XXXX. I have spoken numerous times before I started to take names and employee ID s. Those names are as follows  XXXX # XXXX XXXX # XXXX and their supervisor XXXX # XXXX. I requested a supervisor when I was not getting a comprehensive answer to any of my questions and concerns. I also kept giving my cell phone number when speaking to them and asked for the information they have on file to be changed. That never happened even when XXXX said,  I will email my supervisor and give him that information to return your call  only then did I get a call back because I told them that I had to get a lawyer involved. When XXXX did call me back it was on my HOME phone number which I specifically asked them NOT to call me on, just the number I gave XXXX and XXXX. When I asked XXXX why he called me on that number he just said,  Sorry . Really? Am I supposed to have faith that the people in charge of my mortgage will do it right when they can not even get a proper phone number? I had asked him to explain the shortage and he tried to tell me that it was from XX/XX/XXXX. I keep all the paid bills and cancelled checks along with my balanced check books regularly. As you can see I keep accurate records of all my mortgage and tax bills along with my homeowners insurance. When I asked XXXX to fax my lawyer over the documents requested he tried to tell me that he would email to me. I had told him that it was too late because now my lawyer would like to look them over. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, my lawyer has not received anything from Ocwen. I find this a disgrace of the company and complete disregard for a loyal customer. I told XXXX that I will pay the amount that was previously billed and that if Ocwen wanted to increase that amount that they would have to provide me with evidence of such an increase. I had no choice but to file a complaint against Ocwen and their employees because of such disregard and incompetence. I have an outstanding line of credit and it will NOT be ruined by a mortgage company that can not do their job correctly. I am OUTRAGED to say the least. 
Credit reporting;I had a state tax lien on my CR. The state withdrew the liability and I was sent a letter to verify the withdrawal as well as a court filed CERTIFICATE OF RELEASE. I was assured by the state, once I sent that to all XXXX bureaus, the CB agency would delete the tax lien from my CR s. I did as required. RESULTS? NOTHING DELETED! Equifax told me that a  certificate of release  is not a withdrawal, and the attached withdrawal letter is not valid ( A FORMAL CA FTB LETTER that said I was not liable for debt and the balance formally reporting should be deleted as balance was {$0.00} by withdrawal ). I told Equifax it was supporting evidence with the filed Certificate of Release that was an official copy on record! They told me the tax lien stays and they verified it with the County. I called the county recorder s office and they told me,  NO they do not verify with us because we do not report to any bureaus . The State XXXX also does not report to any credit bureau. So how do they get our public records? The bureaus get the info by sending 3rd parties out to county recorder s offices and collect all public records filed in the court! That is how the bureaus get public records. More importantly the county also told me, if they verified info on me, they would have seen there is a release and it should have been deleted from CR. After 2 hours arguing my case with Equifax, I was angry and frustrated. I told them, I gave you Official State, Federal and Local Govt documents stating the lien is released. I gave you supporting evidence. Now, you ( Equifax ) give me the law that says the lien stays on my report with a withdrawal of liability and a release of lien! They told me  If you paid ...  I said, I DID NOT PAY BECAUSE IT WAS WITHDRAWN! They told me, they would file another dispute and verify with the county . I told them, that is useless because you actually do nt verify because if you did, you would know that State of CA only has XXXX legal certificate they file with the courts for withdrawal : THE CERTIFICATE of RELEASE. Yes, I verified this for the XXXX time with CA XXXX which they told me that is the only certificate they have ever sent out and they did not understand what the CB s are doing! They also mentioned that they send them out daily but they do nt delete from records after the certificate of release has been sent out. And it is nt the county who is has to delete it ( because the court recorder s office is like a library only archiving what has been filed in court  they can not delete anything from credit bureaus if they wanted to ). The only one who can do that with all supporting evidence of proof ... is the CREDIT BUREAUS! Let me also mention, that Equifax has outsourced their phone agents in the XXXX and that supervisor  could not comprehend putting all evidence together to prove my dispute! When I forced he state to me the XXXX. Code Section law that says a withdrawal and certificate of release is not valid proof for deletion? He stumbled over ambiguous robot wording that is printed on the back of a Dispute Results page. Basically, he tried to push me off the phone and told me I had to call the county ( AGAIN ). I said NO! Transfer me to higher managment person in the XXXX! I was transferred to a gal in XXXX Georgia. Again, she told me same thing even after I told her  My Fed, State and Local Govts all said you have to delete that off my records and they stand behind me ... what do you got?  She also could not show me law that says it stays and I told me,  Maam, I will re-open dispute and verify with county . In the words of the County :  That is just circular thinking! Tell them to delete it  In the words of CA State XXXX :  We only file a Certificate of Release  the bureau has to delete the lien off your CB . In the meantime, CB is over 90 days for correction! 
Debt collection;First Source Advantage called from XXXX asking for me by my maiden name, which i have not used since 1990. All they would say is the call was being recorded and would provide no additional information. I did not provide them with any info, but it has to be a scam. 
Mortgage;This complaint relates to my mortgage, serviced by J.P. Morgan Chase (  Chase  ). In XXXX, I refinanced my home with Washington Mutual, and the loan was later serviced by Chase. My mortgage payments were timely paid from the refinance date through the end of XXXX. In XXXX, I filed a petition for Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy, and included my mortgage. The bankruptcy was discharged in XXXX of XXXX. I did not re-affirm my legal obligation to pay the loan. In XXXX of XXXX, a lawsuit was filed against Chase on my behalf to defend a foreclosure. The state court ordered a temporary restraining order. Chase removed the matter to a federal district  this matter was later dismissed. Following the dismissal, Chase again attempted to foreclose on my home. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau against Chase regarding their mortgage practices. This foreclosure was cancelled pending Chase s investigation. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Chase sent me a loan modification mortgage assistance package. In a letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Chase approved me for a trial payment plan XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ). In XXXX XXXX, Chase offered to modify my loan and I accepted the offer. The purpose for the Agreement was to modify my original loan with Chase. The Agreement remains in effect. During a recent application for consumer credit, I was informed that my modified loan and related payments do not appear on my credit report. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I called Chase to inquire about their failure to report the modification and monthly mortgage payments. Chase representatives responded that it appeared that I did not  reaffirm  the loan during the bankruptcy proceeding, and as such they have no duty to report same to the credit bureaus because and I have no legal obligation to them. Chase s response is faulty, as the modification is a contractual obligation between me and Chase that is legally binding, and is the same as reaffirming mortgage debt. The Agreement contains various loan provisions, including enforceability, obligations, maturity dates, and payment schedules. Such provisions clearly relate to XXXX parties financial and /or legal obligations to comply with the terms of the Agreement. It is unconscionable for Chase to state that the Agreement modifying my mortgage loan and the payments are not reportable to credit bureaus, because I allegedly did not  reaffirm  my debt. It is clear that despite numerous lawsuits against Chase, its practices continue to be anti-consumer. My request is for Chase to immediately notify each credit agency ( XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) of the modified loan and report all payments under the trial payment plan and Modification Agreement. These payments are from XXXX XXXX to the last payment. 
Credit reporting;I went onto get my free annual credit report and Experian said they were unable to process my request, ( although I had just received my report from XXXX and XXXX ), however Experian was willing to mail me my report for {$20.00}! I feel as if I have just been cheated! 
Money transfers;HiThis is regarding to a money transfer request done by me thru Remitly. The money did get transfer as promised and they are not ready to cancel the transaction and refund my money.Requesting to please help on this 
Mortgage;My business collapsed in 2013, forcing my wife and I to leave our home and move in with family. My mortgage company, America s Servicing Company, took possession of the house and changed the locks before they were supposed to ... and before we could remove all of our possessions. We applied for a deed in lieu of foreclosure, XXXX. Our initial paperwork was lost. I contacted you last XXXX ( 2013 ) regarding our situation, and they were fairly quick to respond. Since then, we have had XXXX home preservation specialists, had our home in active foreclosure ( with XXXX auction dates ), and have been told most recently that there were no plans to foreclose and our deed in lieu has been approved. We were told to contact Mississippi Home Corporation to arrange for authorization for ASC to request that they subordinate their lien on the property ( we received money through the Hardest Hit program to try and keep our home ), which we have done, in writing. After receiving a notice that we are now assigned to our latest home preservation specialist ( # XXXX ) just a couple of days ago, we receive a letter from an attorney s office that we are indeed being foreclosed on ( again ) and being sued for over {$210000.00} on behalf of the primary lienholder. We ve had no other recent communication from ASC regarding our account aside from our monthly statements. I will be writing to the attorney to attempt to postpone the sale ( no date yet ). Please help us if you can. 
Debt collection;Received a call from this debt collector. They demanded paperwork that they refused to provide and refused to offer an alternative when informed that I could not fill out said paperwork or even find it. When I requested assistance, all XXXX persons spoken to refused to provide it and refused to provide any information on any XXXX assistance. They also refused to accept proof of XXXX and refused to make any accommodation stating that the phone was breaking up on my end ( and that they had  perfect phones  ) and they did not understand me, but responded to statements easily and only claimed phone problems when I was attempting to explain my problem with them. They also heard all other dialogue excepting what they did not wish to ( e.g. that the amount they were demanding was a fraudulent transaction ). No names were given, when I indicated that no classes were taken nor permission to initiate what the representatives called a  loan  the statement was ignored. I stated this XXXX times. In addition, no letters were sent indicating this debt even existed or that I had the right to dispute it. All XXXX representatives also threatened ( not stated, but VERY clearly threatened ) to not only report the debt if not paid today ( XX/XX/2015 ) but that the report would ( NOT could, but would without any doubt ) prevent me from obtaining a  mortgage, loan, credit card, and even cable/satellite  in those exact words. Finally, the recorded portions of conversations were partial and started at varying ( and terribly convenient ) times. The company provided only the name  Malcolm S. Collection  and additional information was requested but never provided. I requested no further contact from them but XXXX additional pre-recorded calls were made after the request. 
Debt collection;I received a notice from Medical Revenue Service ( MRS ) on XXXX alleging I owe a debt in the amount of {$530.00}. I submitted a validation/verification of the debt to MRS on XXXX, because I have been a XXXX. They received my request on XXXX via XXXX Certified Mail, disputing the allege debt, advising MRS that I was not the debtor in question. MRS responded to my request of verification/validation on XXXX with an allege bill that I had no knowledge of. I submitted another letter to MRS on XXXX for further verfication/validation which they received on XXXX via XXXX Certified Mail. MRS responded to my XXXX request on XXXX advising me that they are not willing to provide me with any further documents to verify or validate that I am the debtor. They responded with the same allege billing statement they sent on XXXX. I dispute the debt in question and I am not responsible for any portion of the debt that MRS claim I owe. MRS have not and are refusing to verify that I am the debtor and continue to try and collect on an unverified debt. MRS have not proven that the alleged debt is mine, nor have they willing provided me with my request of a ( 1 ) XXXX agreement between me and their client ( 2 ) they have been assigned to collect on the original creditors behalf and ( 3 ) I am the debtor in question. This violates the FCRA and FDCPA, according to the laws of collection practice. 
Debt collection;I got a call form portfolio recovery associates stating that i owe a debt from XXXX XXXX from XXXX that i have no knowledge of. I was sent a identity theft affidavit to fill out requesting a lot of personnel info 
Money transfers;On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I was scammed by XXXX people in NY by way of XXXX XXXX. When I checked on the cards, I was able to recover {$450.00} out of the {$850.00}. I filed a police report and numerous consumer complaints including the Attorney General s Office. When I realized I had been scammmed my banker and I called XXXX under ticket # XXXX XXXX, the company representative asked us to fax all of the documents to him. We did that. He then stated on speaker phone in front of my banker that I would receive a refund in 23 days for the scammed {$400.00}. The check never came. I called again today and the representative stated that I can not get a refund. XXXX Blackhawk Networklied to me. They will not stand by the word of their company representatives. I have my bank manager as a witness.

Student loan;A loan company by the name of ACS mailed me a letter stating I owed almost 5,000 dollars in student loans to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have attended classes there but have taken only XXXX XXXX loans which I have paid for. Up until recently I have not gotten notifications of said 5,000 dollar loan and I have not applied to said loan. I looked up Acs and I saw that it was a fraud debt collector and would like to report. 
Credit card;I have had a Bank of America card for 17 years. Within the past year, I ve had XXXX problems with this account. The first problem is that the emailed statements have not been delivered regularly since XX/XX/XXXX. This has resulted in several late charges. I checked my junk mail folder and deleted items. I received a statement on XX/XX/XXXX and Did not receive another unil XX/XX/XXXX. This leads to the second and more serious problem ... I logged into my account on XX/XX/XXXX to pay my account. This payment did not go through. Bank of America has a record of my log in, however  they do not have a record of my payment. In XXXX, frustrated with the late fees and the email problems, I paid off my balance and cancelled my card. On XX/XX/XXXX I recieved another statement. Again, my payment did not go through. I called Bank of America and was told that they had a record of this payment, but that they ( Bank of America ) had cancelled it  for some reason, maybe it was a glitch.  This transaction was cancelled with out my concent and without notification. I m trying to get the late fees reversed for the XXXX, XXXX, and now XXXX statements. After an hour on the phone, Bank of America admits their mistake with the XXXX transaction, but not XXXX. The Bank of America representat stated that the case is currently pending an internal investigation. 
Debt collection;For the past week I have received calls from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Calls would come in everyother day with the exception of the past XXXX days. The past XXXX days have been everyday. Each time they called XXXX in a row. When I answered each time they hang up. Finally yesterday XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015, after getting hung up each time i answered, I called back to see who it was. The Company is called Bay Area Credit Services. The guy who answered wanted me to give him my social, I declined to shre that info with him and he declined to tell me the reason for their numerous calls to me. So i then told them to CEASE AND DECIST all calling to me. They promised to quit calling. This morning at XXXX, they did it again. So I called back and spoke with a  XXXX XXXX  who advised me that his supervisors name was a  XXXX XXXX . He confirmed that yesterday I requested calls to stop, but then he began to argue with me as to what I meant. When I told him to Cease and Decist all calls, he said that it would only pertain to the XXXX phone number they reached me at. I am no Rocket Scientist but when someone says to Cease and Decist all calls to me, that should mean to quit calling me and communicate with me by other means such as by mail. I have yet to receive a letter of confirmation for a debt. 
Credit card;I have a credit card with US Bank, a XXXX XXXX Personal Visa Card. This account was opened in XX/XX/XXXX about XXXX months ago. They just sent a communication they are cutting a core benefit of this card on XX/XX/XXXX, A XXXX hotel night will no longer be offered when booking reward stays of XXXX nights or more. This was the primary reason I opened my account. As part of the Card Act / CFPB rules, I thought issuers were not allowed to XXXX cut card benefits in the first year of cardmembership, and XXXX charge an annual fee for a benefit ( Which I paid at opening ) and then remove that benefit in the same year the annual fee is paid. I feel I was seriously deceived and misled and deserve a refund of my annual fee at the minimum, and additional points/compensation for a credit pull under false pretenses. Thanks for the help, XXXX 
Mortgage;PennyMac Loan Services is saying they are unable to provide home mortgage assistance due to a temporary financial hardship. We have been going back and forth with the company for XXXX months providing all the documentation we can and they now say that due to a job loss ( that was present at the time of initial application ) they are unable to provide any mitigation ( no loan modification, no temporary forbearance ). It is my understanding that those types of plans are meant to assist homeowners in keeping their home during a financial hardship. PennyMac Loan Services does not seem to provide these types of services. 
Consumer Loan;Car Dealer persuaded me to take a loan with Capital One Auto Finance for a lower rate. I received information in the mail, but have been unable to pay the bill. There online bill payment says that I am locked out. My wife and I have spent over XXXX hours attempting to resolve this on their web site and on the phone with their customer service. We have reset passwords and we are not able to pay our bill. This has been going on for a week. It is not reasonable for a loan company to make it so difficult to pay the bill. I have been trying to pay the bill early. Imagine the people who wait and try to pay the bill at the last minute. The company has limited hours to help with these problems. Their web sit does not allow you to reset a pin ( if the web site did work which it does not ). When you contact their service representative, he is insulting and unhelpful. He implies it is your fault for not being able to use their system properly. Capital One sends information about how easy it is to pay your bill, but their system is not usable. There is no way to pay your bill. I have just now received a letter from them that we can pay be online, by phone, and by mail. I was told by the customer service rep that I could not pay by phone until the system was set up. It looks like I am suppose to pay by mail as my only option. I do not have any confidence that they will correctly process my mail payment. So I guess I need to use certified mail which adds expense that exceeds the amount of money that I was suppose to save using their loan. I can not express to you how strongly I feel that this is an unethical company. 
Bank account or service;I have been unemployed for the past XXXX months. I just started work this week, and got funds going back into my account. I had {$30.00} set aside ( the only funds that I had ) for my bus ticket from XXXX to XXXX to visit my elderly parents for XXXX. Chase bank gave me without warning a {$12.00} fee because I have not been making the direct deposit amount. Which I understand, I did not ask to waive it just to postpone it, they refused because they have waived it in the past. {$12.00} to Customer Care Specialists XXXX XXXX of XXXX Ohio is nothing, but to me it is me not able to go home now for XXXX. She told me not to take it personally but to make other travel arrangements. I just have myself, and my edler parents can not put money in a chase account in XXXX because there is no Chase branches in XXXX or Maryland. She kept telling me over and over to make other XXXX Travel arrangements. I can not bike to XXXX from XXXX, I can not walk. So maybe she is suggesting that a Chase Client hitch hikes to XXXX? I asked very nicely if I could speak to someone higher on the food chain then her, she refused and to  comfort  me it is nothing personal. Yes it is, for XXXX 2015 I am not spending it alone because Chase bank has trained their employees to not even show some compassion to any degree on a holiday. She was clearly low or middle management, I was polite the entire time on the phone she refused to let me even try speak to her supervisor. I did not raise my voice, said please/thank you. Again, I understand it is a fee that needs to be paid since I am not making the direct. But All I needed was XXXX more week to pay this {$12.00}. Again this was my bus money to see my family in XXXX for XXXX XXXX, an overnight actually because I am WORKING again late on Fridays. It is XXXX XXXX and I received no warning at all from Chase that I would be receive this {$12.00} fee. NO WARNING. If I knew this, I would have bought my bus ticket yesterday and would be able to go home for XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, https : XXXX, located in the XXXX Ohio HQ . If are you get her on the phone. It is best to politly decline any help from her and call back to get another CSR on the phone. She is not willing to help. I now have alot of time this XXXX XXXX to research policy and let fellow consumers know that it is more important to Chase Bank that they have {$12.00} from you because you have been poor the last month then a customer going to their only family on XXXX or to hitch hike down XXXX for XXXX to XXXX hours because that is the  other arrangement . I am closing with that I did not want it refunded. Just waived for one week so that I could go home. XXXX XXXX of XXXX Ohio ( https : XXXX ) Happy XXXX XXXX!!!!!!! 
Credit reporting;I closed the XXXX XXXX credit card after someone had changed the personal information ( Address, Login, and Password ) on the account. I paid a balance I had not charged just to get the card closed. XXXX XXXX accepted more charges after the card was closed and have sent it to collection. I have tried working with the collection agency, XXXX XXXX and Experian to no avail. They say that I lived at the Pennsylvania address the charges are attached to. I have never lived in Pennsylvania. You can see by the payment history reported to the credit bureau that everything was perfect to the date I closed the account, XX/XX/XXXX. They still reported the account in good standing for XX/XX/XXXX. Then  No Data  for XX/XX/XXXX. Then it shows  Charged Off . There is no data for XX/XX/XXXX because the account was closed. The charges were incurred after the account was closed and XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and Experian refuse to correct the error and remove this from my credit report. Attached are the Investigation results and correspondence with XXXX. 
Credit reporting;Contacted Equifax, XXXX & XXXX regarding unauthorized inquires on my credit report from XXXX. Transunion removed immediately. XXXX removed XXXX. Equifax stated I have to contact XXXX directly for removal if I consider inquiries fraudulent. Sent letter to XXXX as directed. XXXX responded stating I have extended alert on my credit file but no response regarding removal. Sent letter response to Equifax and Experian and still refuse to remove. Sent additional letter to XXXX. No Response to date. 
Credit card;I requested a balance transfer from my XXXX account to my XXXX account. After some time I was concerned because I never saw the payment to XXXX XXXX posted even though the money was deducted ftom my XXXX account. At XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015 I called and spoke to a representative and I shared my concern that my balance transfer was not showing up. He informed me that XXXX XXXX Bank did not accept balance transfers. I was floored because there is nothing in the cardholder agrement that states this fact. I relayed this information to XXXX and they told me that if the payment was returned to them, they will credit my account. I could not believe it when on the XXXX of XXXX I logged in to my XXXX card account and I saw that they had attempted to process the balance transfer. I called them to see what was going on and I was informed that my account was suspended. Now this is amazing to me because I have never missed a payment. The balance transfer was meant as an extra payment on my account. On XXXX XXXX I spoke with XXXX and he informed me that they would pull the phone call to verify what I was told by the representative on XXXX XXXX regarding balance transfers. He said that if I had been advised with incorrect information, they would resolve the issue and I could resume making my payments online. I was waiting to hear about the outcome of the investigation, but I received a letter in the mail today ( XX/XX/2015 ) stating that I need to destroy my card and that I had violated my card holder agreement. This is unacceptable behavior from this company. They have incompetent Customer Service Reps and they punish the customer for it. I do nt want any damage to my credit from this company. I have documentation from XXXX saying the balance transfer was returned from XXXX XXXX Bank. ( XXXX Card ). 
Credit reporting;Contacted Equifax regarding unauthorized inquiries on credit report. Equifax stated I would have to contact company directly and let them know inquiries were fraudulent and request removal. Sent certified letter to XXXX XXXX and XXXX as directed by Equifax and no response from company. Contacted Equifax regarding no response from company and still refuse to remove. 
Credit card;My employer requires us to have a credit card from J. P. Morgan Chase Bank NA for specific travel expenses. My account is set up with Chase for automatic payment. Last month, they failed to process the payment in the month it was due. Instead they processed it in error several days later and showed my account as past due. In addition, because of their error they reported me as past due to my employer. I suspect this is a problem with the Chase system that impacts many consumers. This problem, created by Chase Bank, could result in significant consumer harm with customers incurring additional expense in a variety of ways and potential for incorrect negative reporting on consumer credit reports. 
Payday loan;I revoked my ACH authorization because this company is charging me fees ( {$250.00} ) biweekly which they did not disclose to me, and are misrepresenting their interest rate. They showed me a contract with significantly different terms on it and then claimed that I signed a contract with entirely different terms. They refuse to provide me with a copy of this contract, never gave me a written copy of this contract as promised and refuse to disclose a breakdown of how much they claim I owe or of my payment history etc. I want to pay the amount that I borrowed MINUS fees & grossly misrepresented interest charges. I am willing to pursue this legally if the company will not accept this as settlement for this loan. I ask that this company NOT CONTACT MY EMPLOYER, REFERENCES, etc BUT THEY HAVE AND WILL NOT STOP. 
Bank account or service;bank of America has a atm suspicious activity program which use to be voluntary but now seems to be mandatory. although some still say you can opt out, I try what they say to do it but so far no luck. this sounds great in theory but it is actual harassment. they freeze you card, the only way you know it is them is by e-mail or phone call. if your in a store and do nt have a cell phone, your screwed as everyone thinks your out of money or them the trans has to be void and you leave in shame and once you get home and call them or get the e-mail, then your on hold to get to a person for XXXX minutes, then the person wondersw why your upset- well duh!!!!. then in my case since I was at the drug store getting medicine I have to face the embarrassment of going back there to finish what I started. this would not be so bad if I had not already done what the rep told me to do last month when they froze my card for suspicious activity at the same store. so when I got the rep on the phone I went through the list of where I work, where I shop, the drug store, everywhere I might use the card so this would not happen again, they said that this was what I needed to do since they could not find a way to opt me out of this nightmare. low and behold I get up on the day before XXXX, buy a XXXX book from XXXX, which I told bank of America I was a junkie for, and go to the drug store and post office, which I told them I go to and guess what, they freeze it and I have to walk out the drug store, no medicine XXXX drive home check the mail, call them, wait on hold XXXX minutes, answer stupid questions all for a im sorry, then go through the embarrassment of going back to the store and not having them think I am a broke moocher. if bank America would go back to letting this be optional or finding a way to let people opt out of this esp if they already have this service from others then things would be a lot better 
Credit card;American Express sent me promotional offers to open credit cards. I applied for the XXXX XXXX XXXX paid the {$75.00} annual fee and spent {$3000.00} in the first 3 months. The promotion said I would receive XXXX XXXX points for this activity. I never received the points and when I called to complain they just said I received bonus points in the past and therefore was ineligible. I also open an American Express Rewards card via a mailer. Once again the promtion stated I would receive XXXX reward points if I spent {$2000.00} in the first 3 months. The same thing happen. They said they had no record of this promtion on my profile and I was again ineligible. I also receive multi page ( XXXX pages ) mailers at least XXXX a month stating changes in their policies. I can hardly keep up with these changes and when you call to complain they say you need to read your credit card agreement. Needless to say I m quite upset with this company and plan to close ever account with American Express. I feel this company is mis-leading the public and their business practices should be reviewed. 
Student loan;To whom it may concern, I called Sallie Mae to proactively figure out a rate reduction plan that would help me pay less per month with a lower interest rate due to increasing living expenses. I have good credit and I have been making my payments -- I m actually ahead right now because I started paying large sums per month before my loans went into repayment. My Sallie Mae loans will soon require I pay a hefty {$350.00} per month  this is on top of my other Federal loans and living expenses. My Sallie Mae loans are for less than my federal loans, but I pay more for them per month. The Sallie Mae representative told me that the only way I could potentially work out a rate reduction or refinancing plan with them is if I am currently under hardship. I explained that I am not, necessarily, under hardship -- though I do nt know what qualifies as  hardship  -- but that I will soon be due to changes in my living situation. I will not be able to afford a {$350.00} to Sallie Mae and also pay for rent, utilities, insurance, etc ... The Sallie Mae representative seemed to sympathize with me, but she also seemed bound to an unspoken rule that disallowed her from helping a borrower who was looking to proactively take steps in order to not become delinquent on their loans. I need to figure out a refinancing or rate reduction plan with Sallie Mae before I suffer from delinquency, which could happen as soon as XXXX months from now when I move and settle in a different area. I m filing this complaint because Sallie Mae is not willing to work proactively with me as a borrower to stop delinquency, forbearance, or bankruptcy from happening. 
Debt collection;Portfolio Recovery continually calls my home number. I have informed them repeatedly that the debt they are pursuing is not my debt. I have informed them that the last XXXX SSN # digits and the birthdate they have on record of the alleged debtor is not mine. I have a common surname and first name. I have given Portfolio Recovery express orders to not contact me yet they continue to do so. They will not answer query s from me about who they are and why the still call my home number. I do nt know if Portfolio Recovery is even their legitimate business name. It is the name that displays on caller ID. They are rude and uncooperative. Thank you for your consideration in this matter. 
Payday loan;Borrowed {$300.00}. And had a 100 dollar fee. Then a 55 dollar fee then the day it was due they added another fee of 55 dollars! I ended up paying 500 dollars for a 300 dollar loan! Somebody ripped me off! Thanks! 
Debt collection;I entered credit counseling to consolidate and pay off my debt on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and made monthly payments until XXXX of XXXX. At completion I received notice that I had completed the program and that they debts were paid in full and that notice was also provided to the creditors. As a side note I do know that payments were made to the creditors as I recently received a repayment of overpaid interest from another account. I have disputed the debt with LVNV/XXXX multiple times, most recently in XXXX of XXXX. XXXX again it was deleted. While applying for a mortgage I discovered that the debt was incorrectly being reported again as an active collection, despite having provided the evidence of the credit counseling program, and successful completion. The evidence sent showed the correct account number, and debtor. I also received a letter from the collector that despite matching account number and documents showing completion was insufficient evidence, but did not provide any evidence the debt is still owed. 
Student loan;Mohela called me on XXXX/XXXX/15, I told the rep I was at work he then advised me it was an urgent matter. I was concerned so I asked my team lead to give me about XXXX minutes because I had an urgent phone call. I then verified my information and he then informed me I was past due on my loan ( only XXXX days ) but the payment was pending in their system because I always make my payment through their system. I had to tell that rep the payment was already made and that he should have looked at the payment screen before he asked me to make a payment. This incident has happened before when a payment was made but not yet posted. I was only XXXX days late, I started a new job and my paydays are different from my previous employer, I have never been XXXX days late with them and this matter was not an urgent matter because the payment was already and I felt like they wasted my time, the co-signer and was upset because she states no one told her a payment was pending in the system. It seems to me that Mohela wants to misled and employ scare tactics, the payment was made for the XXXX and the money came out of my account on the XXXX ( it was showing as pending in my checking acct on the XXXX ). Mohela has did this to me before, I had to tell the rep to look into the system because I made a payment, I also heard a call my mom recorded of Mohela and not one did he tell her a payment was pending in the system, he asked her to make a payment. She was upset with me because they implied she needed to make a payment when I already her one was made but not yet posted, nowhere on that call was that information given. I actually looked online on mohela s online page and the payment was posted on the day I said it would. I also spoke with a consumer rights attorney and he advised me that Mohela should make sure they are looking to see if a payment is scheduled online before they ask someone to make another payment and the rep misrepresented the call by saying it was an urgent matter  it was not an important issue because the payment was made and it was only XXXX days past due. I was nowhere near the XXXX day mark so I am not sure they discussed anything about credit reporting for this payment because it sounded stupid to say such a thing. A supervisor states they have to call when a payment is late ( this is their job ) but make sure you are actually looking to see if a payment was made before you stay anything stupid like asking to make another payment. I was also advised by an attorney that Mohela should not be telling people it is an urgent matter because it was not in this case and nothing about a past due bill is an emergency. It was utterly deceptive and this is not the first time this has happened, I would prefer to get manual calls not computer calls on my cell phone but they told me I had to endure these stupid calls. The rep asked me if I had another phone call number to use, I said no then I was told I would have to endure these useless calls especially since a payment was already made but not posted, it was pending in the system and I wish people at Mohela would take the time to look at the online screen because they wasted my time because I was at work and I had to stop what I was doing to deal with this matter. 
Credit card;I have XXXX credit card accounts with capital one. Earlier this year my husband and I were really struggling due to lose of income. Along with the stress of low income i had a sister sick with XXXX, a mother suffering with what could posablly be XXXX, and a mother in law who is both physicaly and mentally XXXX who also lived XXXX to XXXX hours away depending on traffic who needs us up there quite often not to mention my husbands an only child. I also work full time in a very demanding job with an equally demanding boss so between my streeful job and personnel life i was finding it difficult to keep up and remember absolutely everything and knowing at the time I was only able to afford to make the minimum payment on both credit card accounts i took the initiative to call capital one and set it up to were they just automatically took out the minimum due out each month on the credit cards until I could afford to do otherwise. A few months later I reseved a letter in the mail from capital one stating that I had not paid on my accounts in months and they were about to close me out. In shock and upset I called capital one only to find out that they had already closed out both of my accounts. I tried to explain to them that I had spoken to XXXX of there represenitives and had my payments set up to be automatically taken out of my bank account each month that there must have been a horable mistake made all I got from them was my accounts have been closed out and that there was Absolutely nothing they or I could do to reopen them and nothing they could do to help me. Devistated and in tears I tried to look online for other capital one departments to call for some help with my situation but no matter what department I tried to call it always just took me back to the original department that I first talk to who refused to help me. At this point in time I have paid XXXX account off in full and current stuck making payments to an account that I ca nt no longer use and my credit score that I have worked so hard to rebuild has been greatly effected all because capital one a company who I have been a loyal customer and until this payment arrangement screw up I have always paid on time to on both credit card accounts since I got them 2 years ago refused to help or even hear me out. I will take fault in the fact that I should have paid better attention to my bank statements and made sure the money was being taken out as arranged but I do nt feel that I deserve to have both of my accounts closed out and my credit that I was working so hard to rebuild ruined over an unfortunate misunderstanding. I was nt even given the chance to plead my case even though it was there company s screw up and did nt follow threw with our payment arrangement. I would like to have the chance to be heard and have the possibility of having my accounts reopend and to not have all my hard work be for nothing I think that s the part that bothers me the most. At this point I feel hopeless that I will get any cooperation from capital one and pray that you can help me. 
Bank account or service;Bank of America, which is my own bank, took my whole XXXX check from my account to go towards a charged off auto loan. This is only my second XXXX check received. They gave me know warning beforehand. I got XXXX certified letter today that states they took the funds and will take more. I ca nt pay my rent, utilities, meds etc. they took the whole amount. I have read that this is not legal. Please help! XXXX, Oregon 
Credit reporting;TRIED TO OPEN BANK ACCOUNT AND XXXX SYSTEMS REPORTED THAT MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER COULD NT BE MINE GIVEN THE SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS WAS AVAILABLE FOR ISSUE IN XX/XX/XXXX IN NY, HOWEVER, I WAS BORN IN XXXX MARYLAND IN XX/XX/XXXX NOT NY. 
Prepaid card;i loaded my card and i made an online purchase in XXXX, in XXXX of this year i loaded more funds on the card and made a few purchases, then when i checked my card it said i had XXXX dollar left avaliable to me, upon calling them i was told that i had a pending transaction for XXXX dollars back in XXXX, and that when i used my card and loaded it they took the XXXX dollars, i do not understand how it is that u get a prepaid card so i can not spend what i do not have avaliable to me. i have spoken to them and i was told that it was a glitz on there end, but then i am not responsible for there mistakes, i would like my eighty dollars back, furthermore i am thinking my card had money on it because i loaded 150 dollars on it and i only made XXXX transactions after loading the card with XXXX dollars, XXXX transactions in the amount of four dollars and twenty five cents, and XXXX for forty-one dollars and another for seventeen dollars then when i go out for dinner thinking i have enough fund to pay for my meal i find out i have no funds avaliable to me, as i understand it a prepaid card can not allow things to go through if u do not have the avaliable funds to pay for it, how can the card company allow a transaction to go through when u do not have the funds on the card, the purpose of having a prepaid card is so u do not over spend.
Mortgage;I had a mortgage with XXXX acct. # XXXX which was sold to Caliber acct # XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX they force placed insurance on my account and for YEARS I sent that I had had proof of insurance and they kept misapplying my payments towards escrow shortage rather than my mortgage & charging late fees. Finally in XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to someone with some sense and they mailed a check to me for theforce placed insurance. SInce in the interim they had sold th loan to XXXX ( Now Caliber ), when they sold the loan they transferred the incorrect amount. Therefore when I would send my payments to Caliber they kept returning them to me stating the payment was not enough to cover the debt. XXXX sent the reimbursement check made out to XXXX AND THEY ( XXXX/Caliber ) STILL returned the check to me stating it was nt enough. I finally thought that this nightmare was over last year, but it has continued to be an ongoing nightmare and my account keeps accumulating late fees & my payments continue being returned with them stating it is not enough to cover the debt. I have had to hire an attorney who also gets the run around. I have contacted the attorney for Caliber and even he can not get an answer from Caliber. Caliber states that they can not waive the previous late fees and misapplied funds because that it what was sent to them by XXXX. What I need:1 ) XXXX to correct the misapplied payments, remove the late fees, update the credit bureau and report the correct balance to Caliber. 2 ) Caliber to waive the late fees, update my credit bureau apply the escrow credit balance and accept my payments for all of the payments that I have sent & have returned to me. I have this amount in my account and just want this nightmare to be over. 
Credit card;On the US Bank XXXX XXXX Visa Card, they are changing the card benefits. THE LANGUAGE, the agreement we signed up for CLEARLY SAYS GET THAT XXXX free night AFTER PAYING THE {$75.00} FEE. They have to live up to their terms & conditions here! 
Mortgage;Dear Sirs, XXXX XXXX, XXXXWe are writing this letter to file a complaint against Wells Fargo home mortgage loan officer, XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo is the builder s preferred lender and she is the dedicated loan officer. Over the life of the application process, she had verbally promised and guaranteed us many times that she would get the loan for us in time in order to close the escrow on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We placed all our trust on her until noontime of the Friday, XXXX XXXX, which was the deadline issued by the builder. We had informed her through a final e-mail we sent to her on XXXX XXXX around XXXX. ( See the attachment ) We did not hear back from her until XXXX on XXXX XXXX. Obviously, we missed the deadline ( {$1000.00} penalty ). Plus, we lost all faith in her abilities since we did not receive any timely or a scheduled update on the loan progress. We called her XXXX between XXXX-XXXX on XXXX XXXX. The XXXX one she did nt answer and the XXXX one she answered but said she would call us back, but she did nt call us back until XXXX. To avoid from paying the late closing penalty {$500.00} per day ( the rule imposed by the builder ), we finally decided to give up on XXXX and Wells Fargo, and tried to close the escrow with cash and some third party funds that we borrowed ( but with high interest rate ). We were only short of {$330000.00}. So at XXXX we decided to borrow a fast loan from XXXX as a bridge ( third party ) loan. This cost us {$5000.00} ( see the attachment, {$5000.00} processing fee plus 10 % interest ). Between XXXX-XXXX, we drew up XXXX cashier s checks, signed and notarized the lending forms from XXXX, and tried to get to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Even with our tremendous efforts, we still ended up paying {$1000.00} penalty to XXXX because the {$330000.00} could only be arranged by the next business day ( Monday ). Thus, if this process started on Thursday, then we would have been able to record the closing by XXXX. What we are trying to say is, we would have planned this out better if -- 1. XXXX gave us constant update such as XXXX every 2 hours, instead of 1-8 hours or more, and/or2. XXXX gave us some indication on Thursday XXXX or Friday XXXX that she is not going to be able to come through. If we had an idea of the likelihood of it coming thru on Thursday, then we would have gotten this hot money prepared for Friday. When we talked to XXXX on Friday XXXX at XXXX, we were still under the impression that we could make the XXXX deadline, since she said Wells Fargo just needed the Appraisal Department to conduct a quick rental survey on the XXXX properties we have. Instead, we did not hear back from her until Friday XXXX. Even though we had left numerous voicemails and emails on her system. Further evidence that XXXX did not keep her client confidentiality private. She openly discussed the case with the seller s agent. In conclusion, XXXX was the preferred lender for XXXX XXXX and she had issued us XXXX pre-qualified letters for the XXXX lotteries we joined ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ). There should be no reason for us not to get a loan in time. She has known our financial status since XXXX, and we had worked with her for over one year. Last but not least, XXXX was trying to do a much bigger loan than we wanted or needed. We told her at least XXXX times ( both in verbal and written ) that we only wanted to do a loan of XXXX or less than $ XXXX. Her greed of urging to get a bigger commission caused her failure on this loan process. 
Mortgage;I have my 30 year fixed mortgage at 5.5 % with Citibank. I have been a XXXX of theirs since 2008 and pay my mortgage on time every moth. Two years ago when mortgage rates dropped near 3 % I applied to refinance my mortgage and they said no. Why? Because my ratio did nt work for them. I had steady income, albeit not a great salary. I could have really used that break to help me put more away in my savings. I had quite a bit of savings and other assets. My friends whose salaries were very healthy took advantage of these great rates and they now they are sitting even prettier with lower interest rates and low mortgages but the folks who really needed the help were flat out denied. Citibank gave me a mortgage when I was unemployed in 2008!!!! My husband had just left with all of our savings and I was barely getting by on food stamps but Citibank wanted me as a customer and gave me a mortgage! I have never missed a payment. Shame on Citi. I would never recommend to anyone going with such a large institution with a very small heart. 
Credit card;Arrived at XXXX XXXX from XXXX for a 4 day vacation on XXXX XXXX. The following day, XXXX XXXX, went to XXXX and when I attempted to pay with my Capital One Card, it was declined. I immediately called customer service and spoke with FRaud Supervisor XXXX who required I provide him with the place where my social security was issued and my driver s license number. He informed me he would reactiviate my account. The reason the purchase in XXXX was declined was because I made a purchase in XXXX and now in XXXX. Later that same day another purchase was declined and when I called, I was told my card was compromised and nothing could be done until Monday to reactivate the card even though the questionable attempts to use the card were the only ones documented by me. Even though I informed XXXX and later XXXX that I will be forced to sleep in my car and cancel my vacation without the use of this card, they said nothing can be done until MOnday when management is present.

Debt collection;For the last FOUR years, I have been receiving multiple robo-calls to my home  attempting to collect a debt  however it is not a debt that I personally owe. The person who had this phone number before me owed many debts, and I have managed to remove myself from the list for being contacted by all the other companies/agencies that have been calling, except for XXXX. I do nt even know the reason for the debt or the name of the company, but I have called them back at the number given many times. Most of the time I can not be connected to a real person when I call, but when I have been able to speak to a person, I have given my name and contact information and explained that the person who owes this debt is NOT me or anyone I know, and asked that they stop calling. It has been more than a month since the last time I called, and I am still receiving phone calls from this agency. Their phone number is XXXX. They do not give any other information in the automated message when they call. 
Mortgage;Bank of America provided oral instructions by telephone on a recast of my mortgage. I followed the procedure and submitted my letter of intent along with a payment of approximately {$15000.00} to be applied to the principal to complete the recast process and have a lower principal balance on which to calculate my new payment. My check for $ 15,000+ was applied to the principal upon receipt, but I never heard from Bank of America XXXX After repeated phone calls over a one month period, I finally reached someone on the phone who told me that we were denied the recast. There was nothing to be done about the {$15000.00} payment that had been applied to the loan. My payment remains the same. No letter of denial of the recast and no letter of apology for shabby treatment was ever sent to me. 
Bank account or service;MY BANK RECORDS FROM ASTORIA BANK WERE RELEASED TO AN ATTORNEY WITHOUT ANY SUBPEONA OR LETTER SEND TO ME REGUARDING RELAESE AND THEY HAVE NO RECORD OF ANY 
Credit card;Ordered a First Progress Credit and submitted {$500.00} as security in XX/XX/2014It took a many weeks for them to process the card. I never went over the credit limit set with my deposit of {$500.00} but they immediately started charging fees and interest on my money. I called to ask about this and was told that is their policy. I cancelled the card in XX/XX/2014. They continued to send me bills. I called again and sent them a letter in XX/XX/2014 to again try to cancel. They sent me a letter agreeing that they would cancel. They said I owed them Approximately {$60.00}, how I do nt know since it was my money. I reluctantly agreed and they said they would send me a final bill. It is now XXXX and I have called a number of times. They continue to send me bills adding on interest and charges even though account was closed. They are very unresponsive and I feel that this Company is scamming people. They are very untrustworthy and prey on people trying to reestablish their credit. 
Credit card;Barclays Bank Delaware is reporting a credit card under my name with a balance of {$6800.00}. This account is not mine, but is being reported to XXXX. XXXX shows the account was opened XXXX/XXXX/93. This account is not mine. 
Mortgage;On XX/XX/2015 I applied for a mortgage with USAA. Due to my income to loan ratio, I was told that I would have to receive approval from their underwriting department, which could take up to 3 business days.  I asked if there was any way to expedite the process because the sellers would like a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) as a guarantee of creditworthiness, and the mortgage representative said there was no way to make the process go faster.On XX/XX/2015 I was called by a USAA Mortgage Representative stating that their underwriting department was wondering if there were more assets that I have available, to which I gave them my XXXX information. I was then told it could be up to another 3 days for a decision.  Again I told the representative of my situation and that I had already waited 2 days, to which I didnt think I should have to restart a 3 day wait again.  He again reiterated there was no way to make the process go faster.On XX/XX/2015 I was notified of my loan approval. I asked to lock in a 3.625% rate program on a 30-year conventional loan, which she said she did.  I was informed they would be sending out my loan paperwork and GFE via XXXX.  I asked the representative to make that GFE available electronically so that I could send it to the sellers of the house I was trying to purchase.  The representative told me she would make the information available via USAAs electronic documents system.On XX/XX/2015, the documents were still unavailable on USAAs electronic document system, however they arrived via XXXX and incorrectly showed a 3.25% interest rate with over $13,000 in origination and discount fees that I had never asked for, nor agreed to.  At approximately XXXX Arizona time, I called USAA to ask what was going on.  A mortgage representative verified that I had locked in a 3.625% rate and that new documents would be sent to me by XX/XX/2015. I informed her that I needed a GFE to give to the sellers and this was already taking 4 days longer than it should have. I asked her to either send the documents electronically or via fax.  She state that contrary to what was told to me the previous day, mortgage documents cannot be sent electronically, and that the department that sends our faxes had already gone home so they could not accommodate my request.

XXXX is a collection agency. They bought the original acct from XXXX s clothing acct # XXXX in which the XXXX delinquent date was in XX/XX/XXXX. What XXXX XXXX is reporting is from the time they bought the acct in XX/XX/XXXX. This account has been delinquent over 7 year and is still reporting to all XXXX credit report agencies. I ve sent letters to XXXX XXXX and to the credit reporting agencies requesting this to be deleted and both are not complying nor are they spending the amount of time to investigate to get the accurate info. 
Mortgage;XXXX Loan inception. Was assured that twice monly partial payments were permitted. XXXX Divorce. He signed quit-claim. Bank would not remove hime from loan unless refinanced ( would not restructure ). Did not qualify for refinance. Tired several times. XXXX was told that the only way they could restrudture was to allow loan to go into foreclosure. XXXX Bank neglected to pay homeowners insurance from escrow. I was not notified. Bank forced surplus insurance. XXXX to present. On and off calls to bankd re : insuance. Was told I had to wait until renewal to replace surplus with my own insurance. Meanwhile, I moved XXXX times and did not receive any notice. Present : Multiple calls and letters to bank. Some respnse that someone would reseaach, but no followup. The latest was XXXX XXXX at XXXX  fter no word or return calls for XXXX weeks, found that he was no longer with company. Loan was about to be foreclosed. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX approved foreclosure. She noted tht there were over XXXX file notes that not her concern. Foreclosure due to non-payment for over 108 days. I HAVE NEVER MISSED A PAYMENT. She is responsible for the forecloser if not paid by XX/XX/XXXX. There are no errors on the part of the bank. I have bank statements and have also provided over XXXX years of accounting trying to track my payments. I filed an insurance/escrow research request with the bank. The loan is scheduled for foreclosure tomorrow. 
Credit reporting;I wrote Transunion on XXXX XXXX. I reviewed their investigation results and let them clearly know I did NOT dispute their findings ( letter attached ). I received a response from them date XXXX XXXX. They did not take anything I asked out of that dispute status. Because of this my mortgage person can not get me approved for a mortgage. 
Payday loan;I borrowed {$700.00} and am attempting to make arrangement with the lender. However the lender insists on charging me 400 % interest and applying all payments to interest first. This is completely usurious and unconchionable. The contract should be void as a matter of public policy. 
Mortgage;On XX/XX/XXXX, I signed papers for a Reverse Mortgage with Generation Mortgage Company, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX. I had been working with their representative via phone and email on this loan for more than XXXX months. She was very helpful and knowledgeable, yet when the closing representative came to my home, he brought incorrect documents for the wrong type of Reverse Mortgage. There were XXXX pages in the paperwork and I inadvertently signed the wrong type of loan. I trusted that Generation Mortgage filled out the right paperwork and I trusted that I should sign where their closing representative told me to sign. Only a few days prior to this I received an email ( which I still have on my computer, showing the representative s information AND the Generation Mortgage logo and information ) from the Generation Mortgage loan processor listing exactly what dollar amounts I would receive at closing, what that first disbursement would pay off and how much I would be left with AND exactly how much ( plus growth ) I would receive on day 366. When I spoke with a supervisor at Generation Mortgage the end of XX/XX/XXXX, she said that the processor no longer works for them and  unfortunately  I signed the wrong type of loan ( the difference is in a fixed rate or a flexible rate loan ). She said the word  unfortunate  so many times that I finally told her  this is WAY more than  unfortunate  to me! I was never told there were XXXX types of Reverse Mortgage loans and I certainly would not have signed the documents had I been told that if I did sign I would be  forfeiting  the XXXX half of my money on day 366! I am a widow. I lost my husband of XXXX years four years ago to XXXX XXXX. I was greatly depending upon this money I was to receive on day 366. My husband and I spent all of our money trying to save his life. This Reverse Mortgage money was supposed to sustain my retirement. I should have received nearly {$30000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I am in dire financial straits, thanks to what I consider to be  bait and switch  tactics used by Generation Mortgage. In my opinion, Generation Mortgage needs to simply re-do my loan papers, changing them to the type of loan I was led to believe that I was getting at the time. They need to do this immediately and disburse the XXXX half of my money to me right away. I have forwarded the emails from their representative to the supervisor I spoke with and she said,  I see where your confusion is coming from.  I am NOT confused and I think the emails are very clear. They simply  checked  the wrong boxes on the paperwork giving me the wrong type of loan. 
Mortgage;I sold my townhouse at XXXX WI. It was suppose to close on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The closing Company requested a payoff on Tuesday XXXX/XXXX/2015. I requested the payoff on XXXX/XXXX/2015. I have called and the closing company ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX WI. ) has faxed and requested the payoff daily. I was promised it daily especially last Friday XXXX/XXXX/2015. I have still not received it. I can not pay off anything and they are charging me interest daily besides causing lots of problems. My husband an attorney called and they said they could not give him the payoff with the account number and my social security number. They refused to talk to him. The company is Seterus Mortgage. Loan # XXXX tele # XXXXXXXXThank you, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXXXXXXOr you can contact XXXX XXXX WI. ( XXXX 
Debt collection;I received a call from a XXXX XXXX from XXXX @ XXXX Ext XXXX stating that I owed {$400.00} to XXXX, but they wanted XXXX however they would take less. I asked for a validation of debt he transferred me to someone else who got made because he wanted me to go online & I was at work & told him now was not good to give me a number & I would call at a better time. He got mad & said he was going to tell the debtor I did nt want to pay. Now today XXXX XXXX, 2015 XXXX XXXX had come called people from my XXXX page saying I had used them as a reference. They will now not return my calls as I stated they I was going to make a complaint about their tactics. 
Student loan;Was not contacted 4 years later about some private loan I supposedly took out and they are trying to collect it. I keep trying to call XXXX college but they keep giving me bogus numbers where nobody answers. I called the collection agency to get some information and they will not give me any info at all. They said call XXXX college but again this gets me nowhere with bogus numbers where noone answers or hangs up on me. 
Debt collection;Collection Consultants is reporting a collection account on all XXXX credit bureaus illegally. I had a medical bill with a hospital. I had a payment plan with the hospital while I was investigating the charges. I had NEVER gotten a bill that I demanded. I do not believe I owe this. I disagree that I received some services or goods at the hospital. Neither did my insurance company. Nobody ( not the hospital or Collection Consultants ) has been able to provide to me an itemization of the total bill. When I questioned this the hospital sent the bill to Collection Consultants even though I was paying them. They just stopped sending bills then Collection Consultants sent me a letter demanding the payment in full. I called. I told them I was investigating the charges and that I needed them to send me a copy of their HIPPA compliant agreement with the hospital, a copy of their assignment, and an itemization of the bill including anything that I authorized. They never provided this information. They never validated the debt in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. I did pay them only because I did NOT want it to go on my credit and I was assured it would be removed. The representative said at the end of my XXXX payment plan it would be removed from my credit. This did not happen. They deceived me and did not validate it. They have XXXX things I have issue with. 1- I do not believe they followed HIPPA laws. 2- They have reported this to the bureaus when they did not have a legal right do so because they did not validate their legal right to when requested, 3- they used deceptive practices to collect the debt. They promised me it would be removed. 
Credit card;I attempted to apply for a Discover Card Online. The system did a hard credit pull and then disconnected me from the application process. I called in and was told that another hard pull would need to be done to complete the application. I never agreed to any hard credit pulls in the process and called and advised them of that. 
Mortgage;I am assisted with my mortgage through an agency. Since I am XXXX, XXXX, and on a XXXX this helps me pay my mortgage. GreenTree Mortgage bought my mortgage from XXXX Mortgage XXXX year ago. I have my mortgage amount debited out with auto pay from my credit union and the agency sends the balance through their account which is automatically deposited in Greentree s account from their bank. Periodically Greentree has called me and asked me where was the agency s payment and I have told them to call the agency. In XXXX I received a call from XXXX at Greentree XXXX asking me for XXXX s payment from the agency. After calling the Agency and being advised by them that Greentree should look through their lists of bank deposits and my telling Greentree what they said. I also told them that my portion was being discontinued as of XXXX XXXX and just the agency was paying the full amount. I was asked by XXXX to send proof with the letter sent to me by the agency, along with a cancelled check, my bank statement showing the amount deducted and a letter stating that I no longer wanted the amount I had been paying deducted out of my account. Greentree still deducted the payment and after I called to ask when they were going to reimburse me I was told by the Customer service rep that because I had blackened all the transactions on my bank statement they would nt send me a refund. That I needed to send them a bank statement without the blackening of my transactions. I responded that I did nt blacken the amount withdrawn by Greentree and I believed my transactions were private and there was no need for Greentree to know my business. To this date, I have not received my refund and they are not returning my calls. 
Debt collection;Going through a divorce, my ex and I were unable to pay the mortgage for a few months. The house was sold in XXXX 2010 ( NOT A SHORT SALE ) and the mortgage was paid to Citimortgage PAID IN FULL. After the sale of the house, the law firm handling this case reported the pre-forclosure to the credit bureaus and do nt understand how a mortgage that was paid in full can go to foreclosure. I did not own this house at the time of the filing. CitiMortgage had an moral obligation to discuss the lawyer which they did not. In addition, Citi was part of a class action suit at this time regarding DEFICIENT MORTGAGE SERVICING. 
Credit reporting;All XXXX credit reporting companies, experian, XXXX, XXXX ALL created a new credit history file for me when I changed my name. My SSN remained the same. I am a XXXX woman and I was having trouble getting credit after my transition. When I looked into it I found that all of the credit reporting companies had XXXX files for me. XXXX under my old name and XXXX under my current legal name. I am still in the process of getting this corrected, which means having them merge the XXXX files. They had instructed me to ask all of my old CC and bank loan companies to re-report the information with my corrected name. The ones that would, did but, it STILL did nt show up on my credit report. The merging of the XXXX files for each credit reporting company is where I am now. It has been a HUGE time consuming process. Many days worth of time spent on the phone to correct this issue which NEVER should have happened XXXX. XXXX they should have just started reporting my new name and new credit cards as part of my existing record based on my social security number. If I had an issue with it, XXXX. if someone else had this happen they would see it on their credit report and dispute it. So, why is nt this the default? Being a XXXX person in this society is hard enough. Why do we have to start our credit history all over when we are just trying to live as ourselves. I do nt think most XXXX people would go through the long wait times on the phone and the getting run around ... when they have XXXX records that should just get merged. If I had nt had credit monitoring from before my name change and after I do nt think I would have noticed what was going on ... well not as fast. ALSO, regardless if someone is a XXXX. If someone starts using another person s SSN with whatever name they want, they can build a credit history. So, this is making it easy for someone to create a fake identity / life. Please see about getting the credit reporting companies policy changed with regards to SSN and names. Thank you. A XXXX year old XXXX woman with 12 years credit history from when I was a XXXX and 2 years as a XXXX. Once my files are merged I will finally all 14 years of credit history that I deserve. 
Credit card;I was reported late by Discover Card to the reporting agencies for XXXX and XXXX as XXXX days late for each month, but I was not allowed to change my billing date to accommodate my monthly federal payment date of the XXXX of the month ( which can post as late as XXXX of the month ). I got behind in XXXX and did not make a full payment trying to finish the larger high school tuition payments for my daughter and pay for her college acceptance monies that all took place in XXXX and XXXX XXXX payment was made every month typically the XXXX of the month and based on the online discover website. I paid a huge XXXX monthly payment over XXXX payments {$150.00} ( XXXX ) and {$330.00} ( XXXX ). Now, the discover representative told me today that I have no payment due in XXXX! The balance minimums due in the online system were for XXXX and XXXX? And, they reported me late for XXXX after paying what was asked of {$480.00}. They refused to change my billing payment date until today to the XXXX of each month so the cycle billing date would align me the way I asked for it to do in XXXX. My credit has been adversely affected for the first time in XXXX plus years as I have not been late in the past. AND, I did make payments each month, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The representative did not care that I have been a good customer and always made my payments. And, that somehow I got caught in a billing cycle mess that I just now was able to get out of. BUT, to report me and then say you do not owe a payment for XXXX after all of these payments and report me late XXXX days for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I would still make my payment on XX/XX/XXXX regardless that her system shows no balance due because I make monthly payments. Please help me to get this credit issue fixed if you can. 
Credit card;Home Depot said it was my fault for not paying a bill in in XXXX 2015. I was reported 30 days late to my Credit Bureau for this issue. My account was paid in full for a long period of time and the account had no activity. Therefore, I did not receive paper statements. I had a credit on file for an overpayment that was used and it went four or six dollars pass the credit that caused for a payment to be made. The balance on the account was six dollars and XXXX with a credit limit of {$3500.00}. Home depot reported me as late because I did not make the {$6.00} payment. I received no Bill. Later on they dropped my credit limit to 3,200.00. I called in to dispute with Home Depot and XXXX credit reporting. Home Depot female representative was not helpful. I asked to speak to a supervisor and he said it was my fault and error and not theirs. The business practice of Home Depot with this consumer who has always paid the bill and never late with big or small ticket items is deplorable! I was not treated fairly and felt rejected as XXXX of their customers. I was amicable on the phone and the people infuriated me regarding this subject matter which left a bad taste in my mouth about their business. 
Credit reporting;XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/2015 - While attempting to correct date of birth error in my credit profile via TransUnion website, I received an error message that instructed me to call TransUnion customer service at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I then called customer service representative at XXXX XXXX PDT and was told I needed to call TransUnion dispute resolution center at ( XXXX ) XXXX during normal business hours. XXXX/XXXXXX/XX/2015 - I called TransUnion dispute resolution center at XXXX XXXX PDT and spoke to XXXX XXXX. Happily, XXXX XXXX was able to correct an error in my address history, but unfortunately XXXX XXXX refused to correct my date of birth. 
Payday loan;i applied for a loan in 2011 and due to my credit i was denied a loan. i am now receiving phone calls from a mediation services scompany telling me that i had money deposited to my bank account which was not open during the time they claimed they deposited money and asking me to pay them XXXX dollars for the charge to be filled. I requested the company s address and information and they hung up on me various time. 
Credit card;Because we had dual job losses a few years back, Discover placed us on a few programs to assist us with our payments. We made every payment owed. Our last statement showed that they are now charging us 24.99 % interest. Discover now says that our programs are over and thet we have to wait FIVE years before they will consider lowering the interest rate. It was never explained to us that they would charge such a high rate. We can not afford this. We can not make a dent in the principal because of the extremely high rate. We contacted Discover to ask for help, and were told  too bad.  I fail to understand why we are being punished when we complied with their programs, have faithfully made our payments to them, and are not behind at all. 
Credit reporting;Please investigate the practices of Experian. They have manipulated my credit report and score. They are unresponsive and vague. My score has recently dropped XXXX points yet no one is able to give me a consistent answer as to what has happened. I have filed several disputes and they remain unresolved in addition I have cancelled my monitoring service. 2 days before the cancellation I was notified my score dropped XXXX points. I pay my credit card balances in full every month and I do not have any late payments that are undisputed. In addition, they are allowing a creditor to continue to  update  information that is 15 years old. I have made XXXX calls and spoke with a manager  XXXX  who all provided me with inconsistent and unverified information. I am exhausted with the run around, the responses I receive from Experian are.  We do nt know ,  Probably ,  Contact the lender ,  It will take 30 days for a response  I am in need of assistance from a governing agency above and beyond Experian and again I want a complete review into the very suspicious dramatic decline of my credit score upon cancellation of my subscription service. That is key information and I am willing to contact local media to investigate this company. In addition, it is my concern that this action is discriminatory. PLEASE contact me ASAP, I have been caught in this cycle for over a year and I have pending important matters that I need to take care of that involve my credit. Time is of the essence, I need to bring attention to and STOP this FRAUDULENT behavior. 
Debt collection;Portfolio Recovery does not disclose who is calling or why. Only after looking the phone number up online did I discover that they were a collection agency. They are also trying to collect on debt that is past its statute of limitations. 
Credit reporting;Experian is reporting an item on my credit report on behalf of XXXX, for a credit card that was charged off XXXX, which means the first date of delinq was prior. It is being reported under good standing, which it is not. It was a charged off acct. They state they are reporting until XXXX, past the XXXX years they are allowed to report charged off accts. Since XXXX no longer owns the acct they will not remove the tradeline. I would like for experian to please remove the tradeline, or provide the correct removal date based off XXXX years from the XXXX date of delinquency.

Debt collection;This company attempted to collect on a XXXX XXXX debt that was paid in full. I contacted XXXX XXXX and researched with them and they were not showing a debt owed to them and could not find where anything was reported to this debt collection company. They were showing I was paid in full especially since I had current services with them. I contacted the debt collected company back and informed them off this and they said they would report it and have it removed. This was in XX/XX/2014. The account RECENTLY has been ADDED back onto my credit report and is showing as an open account and they are attempting to collect on it again. 
Debt collection; XXXX  from United Recovery Systems ( URS ) ( XXXX ) keeps calling my client, XXXX XXXX for a debt that she either does not owe or was fully paid in a settlement ( attached ).

Bank account or service;On XXXX XXXX I went to the Citizens Bank on XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, MA and gave my son s bank information in XXXX and wired {$200000.00} to XXXX do XXXX, where my son has a checking account. ( My son lives in XXXX ) On XXXX XXXX, I ve realized there was a mistype in the XXXX he gave to me. I called the Citizens Bank Wire Department and was able to fix the number and they told me the money would be available in XXXX on XXXX XXXX. Until XXXX XXXX XXXX, the money has not arrived in my son s checking account in XXXX, but left my account on XXXX XXXX. I ve called Citizens Wire Department many times and they told me the money was transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX and that XXXX XXXX XXXX would be responsible for that wire transfer. I ve asked if they could trace the money since it s been more than 2 weeks, they ca nt. XXXX XXXX XXXX is the bank responsible for that and if XXXX XXXX XXXX has not called them to say something went wrong, they do nt communicate with XXXX XXXX XXXX, they assume everything went well. Although I ve been calling to let them know it has not. They also told me I could start a process to get my money back in my checking account with Citizens but I would lose the fees I ve paid for the wire transfer to be made. I just want to find out what happened to the money. Even if there was something wrong I should have gotten a phone call or something.. This is not the way a Bank should treat a client/customer who trusted the Bank. This is disrespectful! Another thing, they should clear state to the customers they are NOT allowed to do International Transactions and that their money is going to be transferred to another Bank for the transaction to be complete. I ve got all the dates and time I ve called the Wire Department at XXXX XXXX - XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX minutes on the phoneXXXX XXXX - XXXX USA - XXXX minutes on the phoneMarch XXXX - Director of Bank - XXXX minutes on the phoneMarch XXXX - XXXX - XXXX minutes on the phoneXXXX XXXX - XXXX ( that day finally the lady told me they ve started a trace and someone would give me a call ) XXXX XXXX - One of their employees finally called ( XXXX XXXX ) but until that day they did nt know what happened to my money. I just want Citizens Bank to be responsible for the deal I ve lost in my country - that money was supposed to buy a condo and, of course, I lost the deal! I want Citizens Bank to trace all my phone calls ( They ve been recorded ) and try to figure out WHY their employees did nt take an action on XXXX/XXXX/15 when I made the XXXX phone call to complain about a delay ... They should know better. I used to work for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they call their customers because a {$1.00} coffee. What about Citizens? what do they do for their costumers? I would appreciate someone to please investigate this case and force Citizens Bank to improve the way they treat their costumers and solve situation. Sincerely, XXXX 
Credit reporting;I have written the credit reporting agenecies XXXX and Equifax numerous times in the past serveral months about a company reporting a debt on my file from XXXX XXXX XXXX that sent me a letter stating and i quote as it states in the letter  To XXXX XXXX the purpose of this letter is to advise you that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has closed the above referenced account and will no longer be collecting on this account including account from original creditor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX You have no further financial obligation regarding this account.  It further states that all credit bureaus have been notified ( XXXX Equifax, and XXXX ) to remove this item and correct this from your credit report. I immediately contacted the credit bureaus and they have refused to remove items as directed by the creditor as of yet. As this has brought down my credit score drastically being it was a collection acct.and caused me to to be unable to get loans for cars, mortgages, ect. I demand that you inform these companies of the fact that this needs to be removed immediately.I have an open litigation against Equifax in Civil Court that is pending as of now, as they have refused to remove another XXXX of the accts. on my file XXXX Bank bank loan that has been placed on my credit file that is not mine, they have been asked to removed numerous times and have refused.

Debt collection;Had Hospital Bill over {$20000.00}, Hospital had contract with Insurance Company to pay at contract rate per their contract. Hospital is trying to collect over and above what was contract for. Hospital has sent a collection agency after me and is harassing me to pay an additional amount of money above what the Insurance paid. 
Mortgage;My wife and I came on some hard financial times right at the start of 2010 when she got XXXX. I work from home as a XXXX. We were able to keep both the XXXX and XXXX mortgage payments up while she was collecting unemployment. Once the unemployment ran out we started having serious trouble making XXXX the XXXX and XXXX mortgage payments and fell behind. We turned to the North Carolina Foreclosure Prevention Fund and were approved for their program. The NCFPF then made good our back payments for both mortgages and continued to make payments for a little over a year until our maximum had been reached. By the time the NCFPF ran out my wife got XXXX, and while they are a true blessing it did nt help improve our continuing financial issues. We again got behind on both the XXXX and XXXX mortgages. By this time wife has found gainful employment full time ( 30 hours a week ) with a local bookkeeper. However it took all of our income just to keep the lights on, heat, groceries, car insurance and all the other necessities of daily life and left little to no extra money for the mortgages. We then turned to our local HUD approved agency for assistance with a HAMP modification. The HUD agency is the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. We also sought the assistance of another legal agency, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that provides us with a free attorney. The attorney proved to be very helpful since the XXXX mortgage company has been trying to foreclose on our home for almost a year and we have been to court more than XXXX times, each time resulting in a postponement while we were working through the HAMP process with XXXX. We successfully completed the HAMP process with our XXXX mortgage company and are over XXXX payments into that modification with them. And this is where we start to have an issue. We were told throughout this entire process by our XXXX mortgage company and our HUD rep that once we were approved for the HAMP with our XXXX mortgage company we would automatically be approved for a 2MP with our XXXX mortgage company. The loss mitigation rep at my XXXX mortgage company called late last week and informed us that after their  in house  review for mortgage modification that we did not qualify. Needless to say I was perplexed as to why this was in  in house  review and not under the HAMP law. He did nt really have a good answer as to why we were not eligible under HAMP just that we did nt qualify for HAMP with them, even though all along were led to believe that a XXXX was automatic once the XXXX mortgage company approved us for HAMP. After calling my HUD rep at XXXX she was able to find out that because our HAMP mod with the XXXX was an FHA HAMP we did nt qualify for an automatic XXXX approval. This is something that my HUD rep was also not aware of for this entire process. So now I am filing this complaint on the advice of my HUD rep hoping that I can get some kind of positive resolution to this XXXX mortgage modification issue. This matter is further complicated due to the fact that we have another court date scheduled for XXXX XXXX and the court has a sale date for my property already on the books. 
Payday loan;I received a call from a woman stating that they have a  pending claim  against my XXXX checking account  some sort of  bad checking . No name of the lender or anything is given. She states that I have some charges pending against me as to what they do not give. These people have called my dad as well as my sister under the business name of Integrated Services at XXXX. I looked up this number on another web source and other consumers have had the same issues with these people  they harass, can be rude, and have multiple numbers in which they have used. I believe they are attempting to fraudulently collect monies from me and/or my bank through old payday loan information they obtained. 
Student loan;I was contacted by navient ( XXXX XXXX ) on XXXX XXXX, 2015 at approx. XXXX spoke with lady ( never gave name ) who advised me the status of my account. She advised me that I was 2 months behind at the beginning I told her that I could not pay until XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/2015, she advised me that she needed me to pay today or this month. I told her that I could nt she said that my account would escalate and they would start calling my co-signer. I feel very threatned by navient, I am not sure why she would tell me that my co-signer would be contacted, she is already called XXXX times a day so what changes now? I then asked her for a supervisor over XXXX times, and she never transferred the call. She said to me that she needed to know why I wanted a SUP I advised her to complain on her she still continued to speak and make me feel  threatened  and upset. I am currently suffering from a XXXX in which I am not allowed to have any XXXX and this is why I fell behind in my payments. She made me feel like I did something wrong and worse than I already fill. I then had to call back and request another rep XXXX to speak with a SUP he transferred me immediately. In speaking with the sup he advised me that I could set up my arrangement for XXXX and XXXX as previously requested and in addition he advised me that they had the correct card on file that the very rude rep I spoke with first did claims that I did not have on file. In summary, I feel that Navient has mislead me, harassed me and threatened me about my situation please help. 
Mortgage;My house was current on payments. Another person s bankruptcy took my house, held it for about 30 months, then gave it back to me. During that time they did not make any payments but collected the rent. I attempted to refinance but my existing lender would not cooperate with escrow and my new loan fell apart. I have asked for a loan modification but Chase again refuses to cooperate ( no returned calls, etc ) Now Chase has filed a notice of foreclosure sale but did not post the house and did not mail anything to me. I can not catch up on all the back payments that were started by the bankruptcy that was not my doing. All I want is to keep my house after working out some kind of loan modification with Chase. I feel this action by Chase may be due to me having a XXXX name or that I am a woman owning the house alone. This is urgent as the foreclosure sale is scheduled for XXXX XXXX, 2015 
Consumer Loan;I was searching for a loan online and received an email from a XXXX XXXX XXXX claiming to be a Citi Bank Financial represenative. He said my loan was approved but because my credit score was low I had to pay the first installment so I purchased a green dot prepaid card and paid the fee soon after that I did not receive the loan. He then said the FDC was holding it because I owe taxes and that was what the loan was originally for. I then contacted the fdic and fdc. 
Mortgage;In XXXX of XXXX I lost my job, the account became delinquent in XXXX of XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX I contacted Flagstar in an attempt to bring the account current. Flagstar instructed me to contact Loss Mitigation, which I did in XXXX of XXXX. At this time I submitted the requested information to XXXX XXXX XXXX as instructed by Loss Mitigation. Flagstar contacted me and informed me that they were no longer working with Loss Mitigation. I believe that this is the point in which the account became entangled with multiple departments. Loss Mitigation instructed me to continue making payments, which I did. In XXXX of XXXX my payment was rejected and foreclosure proceedings were initiated. I continued to contact Flagstar to try and remedy the account. I was now dealing with Flagstar and XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, LLP as the foreclosure representative. I retained an attorney and neither my attorney nor I were able to get payoff information from Flagstar or XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, LLP after repeated requests. I finally got a payoff amount and paid the loan and legal fees in full. I believe that at the point that Flagstar ceased working with XXXX XXXX XXXX my account became entangled in Flagstar system and therefore foreclosure proceedings began. Was I able to complete the home retention program then the foreclosure would not have been initiated and it would not be on my credit report. My attorney requested a refund for over payments totaling {$20.00}, XXXX and got no response. I repeatedly requested a refund for the over payments and received a partial refund of {$5400.00} on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I repeatedly requested an accounting of the account and all I ever received was a letter that stated they applied payments to my account. They refunded the {$5400.00} as a  good faith  effort. I am requesting that due to the circumstances described above and that I was working in good faith with Flagstar as instructed that the negative foreclosure information currently on my credit report for Experian, Equifax and TransUnion be removed. I am also requesting that I am refunded the additional {$14000.00} ( {$20000.00} - {$5400.00} ). I would also like to be awarded damages from the settlement announced in XXXX XXXX. 
Credit reporting;When requesting our annual credit reports we also will pay to receive our Credit Score at the time of the report. Experian does not properly disclose ( uses  mouse print  ) that when you pay {$4.00} for the credit score you will be automatically enrolled in a credit score monitoring membership that the consumer is responsbile for calling within a 30 day window to cancel without charge ( {$19.00} per person/per month ). There is no acknowledgement required on behalf of the customer that you agree to this - other than indicating you want to get your credit score. I have been charged for both myself and my husband in XXXX and XXXX 2015 after pulling our initial credit reports and scores in XXXX 2015. I contacted Experian today and they canceled my  membership  and after I mentioned I would be filing a complaint with the CFPB they were  able to refund one month of charges  but that would be all. I work for a financial institution and I find it appalling that Experian is able to do this to consumers without requiring their confirmation/acknowledgement of accepting the service and the associated charges. 
Credit reporting;I recently requested all XXXX of my free credit reports threw XXXX, and had no problem receiving my XXXX, or XXXX reports  however, Transunion sent me a letter changing the apartment number to my address from XXXX to XXXX and denied me my free report unless I send them very personal information in which I object. My reports are frozen at my request because Transunion has been reporting inaccurate information. Transunion suspended my account when I attempted to dispute personal information. Customer service relayed to me she was sending me a new password XXXX times and I never received that password, as promiced to lift the suspension. I had a problem trying to get my free report last year, just the same and am fustrated with dealing with them. 
Consumer Loan;In XX/XX/XXXX I became XXXX payment delinquent on my auto loan with USAA. Upon returning to work in XXXX I called and made arrangements to pay XXXX payment and portion of the past due amount until I was current. In XX/XX/XXXX {$120.00} was applied to late charges despite my intent and misleading statement from the representative who assured me it was their process to apply payments in this manner anyway. When I realized what had happened I spoke with another representative on XX/XX/XXXX who told me this would be corrected my requesting a misapplied payment reversal. Once again the payment I made on XX/XX/XXXX a portion - {$26.00} was applied to a late charge and the reversal that was promised did not happen. After a conversation on XX/XX/XXXX in speaking with a very rude representative and her manager, they basically stated the policy is they always apply to late charge prior to allowing the consumer to pay to past and future payments. I stated this was unfair and deceptive, they stated I had no recourse  but to accept this. In going through my pay history in order to allow these fees to accumulate there has to be a variation of this policy  but they would not consider it. At the end of the day applying in the manner that they claim is  policy  allows the bank to continue to incur fees on top of fees because it would take the consumer a lengthier time to become current. 
Mortgage;I haved lived in thos house for 7 years+. Every year my mortgage goes up and XXXX Mortgage says its because of escrow. When we moved in the payment was 570.00 dollars and has went up like five or ten dollars every year. We get letter this year it has went up to XXXX when will it stop? we almost cant afford the increase! 
Student loan;I took out a loan through Genesis for an education through XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Oh. Under the sale of the debt there was to be a 40 % reduction in my loan. Nothing has been done. At this time this is my complaint. A detailed complaint regarding my federal student loans will be forthcoming as well. 
Bank account or service;The following summarizes my issue with PNC Banks policy, and their refusal to properly rectify the consequence of their mistake. On XXXX XXXX, 2014 I placed a currency exchange order for XXXX XXXX s at the PNC bank located at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Mi. This transaction is XXXX # XXXX. Subsequently, I picked up the money and engaged in a conversation with a bank associate about returning unused monies. At that time I was told that I could return paper money, but that they would not accept coin. On XXXX XXXX I went to the bank to return XXXX paper XXXX for approx. $ 35-40 U.S. At that time the bank associate made a telephone call to determine the exchange rate on the currency. After that call she informed me that the bank had a policy of not exchanging XXXX with a value of less than {$100.00} U.S. In response, I told this associate that I inquired about returning XXXX when I picked it up, and no one told me about this requirement. I certainly could have brought back the required amount if I had known about it, and I told her that the bank was negligent in not informing me about this. I felt that they made an error, and want me to suffer the consequences of their oversight. The bank associate told me that she would discuss the matter with bank management, and someone would get back with me. On XXXX XXXX I received a call from someone at the bank who identified himself as  XXXX . He told me that he checked out my exchange issue, and found that PNC had a policy of not exchanging XXXX with a value of less than {$100.00} U.S., and they could not make exceptions to this policy. I asked him why the bank did not inform me about this when I inquired. He apologized, and it appeared to me that local bank personnel did nt know about this policy. When I asked XXXX about the reason for this requirement he stated,  efficiency s of scale . I pointed out to XXXX that the bank had a XXXX opportunity to make this requirement known to me in written communications, but missed that chance also. As a result of my order, I was given a written record of the transaction entitled  PNC Foreign Exchange Services . This document should have defined the return exchange requirement, but failed to do so. I told XXXX that I viewed this failure as additional negligence on the part of the bank. XXXX was firm in his position that the bank would not exchange the XXXX for me, and he suggested that I try to get it exchanged at the airport. I told XXXX in response that I have been a member of PNC and it s acquired banks for almost 50 years, and I would like to believe I could count on my bank for this service. 
Credit reporting;I have submitted offical documenation to Experian that they are report bad infromation on my Credit file. CitiMortgage Acct # XXXX, IS PAYED in FULL and was never Legally paid in full for less than the full balance  as Experian is reporting on my credit report. Supporting Documents attached. 
Credit reporting;TransUnion continues to report bad and incorrect infromation on my credit report regarding XXXXMortgage., Acct # XXXX. TransUnion is reporting that, Legally paid in full for less than the full balance . This is incorrect, as the BALANCE WAS PAID IN FULL and there was not a settlement for less than the full balance. Supporting documentation attached 
Debt collection;I SENT A LETTER TO THIS COMPANY ASKING THEM NOT TO CONTACT ME. IT WAS A LEGAL LETTER BELIEVE IT IS CALLED A CEASE AND DESIST LETTER. TO THIS DAY THE COMPANY STILL HARASSES ME ABOUT THE ACCOUNT. I CANT HAVE THIS MAN. I WORK OFF SHORE ALOT AND I DONT EVEN KNOW IF THIS IS MINE. 
Mortgage;I applied for a loan modification with Suntrust Mortgage. I qualified for an modification option to convert from an ARM to a fixed rate mortgage. I was 6 years into the mortgage. I am a divorced mother of XXXX and ex-husband was on original loan. In divorce he had to quit claim as I did on his property. Suntrust required him to sign modification application but then when presented with quit claim, allowed me to proceed without his signature. I have completed the 4 month trial period and loan mod docs have been sent to me. Problem : They are now requiring ex-husband signature now. He is an unfriendly/uncooperative party and is trying to leverage his signature with his lawyers for a percentage ownership in the property and other stipulations. Suntrust will not let me sign alone even though I made the application alone and the calculations were based on my income alone. I need them to be compelled to allow me to sign alone. If I ca nt execute this modification I will have to default as I owe 6k on demand to go back to the original structure. The ex does nt care about defaulting he has family money and many lawyers. Please help me compel Suntrust to allow my sole signature on this modification. 
Debt collection;This company continues to report on my credit report after I sent them a letter telling them that this account was not mine and I have no idea what it is or who it belongs to! I asked for proof of a signed contract, I asked for a license to collect in my state, I asked for copies of all information referenced for this debt and still to date, I have not received anything but harassment from this company! THIS IS NOT MY DEBT! I WANT THIS ACCOUNT REMOVED FROM MY CREDIT REPORT AND THIS COMPANY TO STOP CONTACTING ME IMMEDIATELY! 
Credit card;I received a Synchrony Bank Credit Card in XXXX, and signed up to pay online from my checking account at another bank. I do this with all of my credit cards, and have been doing it for at least five years -- without any problem. I thought I made an online payment on XXXX XXXX ( due date was XXXX XXXX ), and received an acknowledgement email, which I did nt look at too closely. When I got an email today that said I had not paid yet, I looked at the acknowledgement email, and saw that it had *scheduled my payment for the due date. * I would never do this purposely, and when I went online to see the scheduled transaction, I saw that it defaults automatically to the due date, not the date posted ( or the next day ). To make sure that this was not something I had done, I cancelled the payment and then clicked the  Make a Payment  again. The page I am attaching is a picture of the Payment Page on the webpage that shows the default payment date ( the due date ) and the note the bank includes about what happens when payments are made on the due date. I believe that this is a deceptive practice, and that the bank should not be allowed to keep this practice. Many thanks for allowing me to report it. 
Debt collection;OK I DONT KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENS, BAD PEOPLE I GUESS. BUT ANYWAYS I SENT THIS PLACE A LAWFUL NOTICE THAT THE ACCOUNT IN QUESTION IS NOT MINE AND SO IT SHOULD NOT BE ON MY REPORT AND SO THEY SHOULD STOP CALLING ME 
Debt collection;XXXX people are XXXX and XXXX you like a dog. I started trying to communicate with XXXX. My credit limit was XXXX. Why is it XXXX?? No one wants to tell me. I am willing to pay my credit limit as an in full payment and am told no. I am also threatened with legal action and XXXX has sent v this to an attorney. The attorney says that in order to settle for just my credit limit that XXXX wants my income, my bank information, my utility information, my drivers license number etc ... information they are not going to get nor are they entitled to get this info. 
Debt collection;THIS IS NOT MY DEBT! I WANT THIS ACCOUNT REMOVED FROM MY CREDIT REPORT AND THIS COMPANY TO STOP CONTACTING ME IMMEDIATELY! This company continues to report on my credit report after I sent them a letter telling them that this account was not mine and I have no idea what it is or who it belongs to! I asked for proof of a signed contract, I asked for a license to collect in my state, I asked for copies of all information referenced for this debt and still to date, I have not received anything but harassment from this company!
